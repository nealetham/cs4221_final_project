<p>Yelp, the News Media Alliance, REX and others signed a letter dated Tuesday which asked for a meeting the week of January 10-14 after Raimondo said in early December that the administration was closely watching the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act being considered by Europe.</p>
<p>"We have serious concerns that these proposals will disproportionately impact U.S.-based tech firms and their ability to adequately serve EU customers and uphold security and privacy standards," she said.</p>
<p>The DSA would force Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook owner Meta to do more to tackle illegal content on their platforms or risk fines up to 6% of global turnover. The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts for U.S. tech giants designated as online gatekeepers with fines up to 10% of global turnover for violations, a global first.</p>
<p>In the letter, the eight companies said that many U.S. companies supported the rules.</p>
<p>"US companies have repeatedly raised concerns about the anti-competitive conduct of those dominant internet platforms and have provided evidence to European policy makers in the drafting of the EU legislative proposals," they wrote.</p>
<p>"We hope that, moving forward, you work to advance the interests of all US companies and of US consumers when interacting with our transatlantic partners," they wrote.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said in a statement that Raimondo supports the goals of the legislation and would continue speaking to European partners about it. "In the video, Secretary Raimondo clearly referred to the long-standing practice of the U.S. government to consult with partners to ensure that their laws don't discriminatorily target US firms," the department said.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by Yelp, Felt, Genius, REX</p>
<p>News Media Alliance, Patreon, OfferFit and Beeper.</p>
