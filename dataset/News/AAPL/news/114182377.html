<p>July 21 (Reuters) - Snap Inc missed second-quarter revenue targets on Thursday as record-high inflation and increasing competition from rival apps like TikTok hurt advertising demand, but it reported higher user growth than Wall Street had expected.</p>
<p>The Snapchat owner is the first of the major tech firms to report second-quarter earnings, and the results could be a bellwether of conditions also affecting Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc, which reports results next week, and Twitter Inc, which reports on Friday.</p>
<p>"We are not satisfied with the results we are delivering, regardless of the current headwinds," Snap said in prepared remarks released ahead of a conference call with analysts.</p>
<p>Revenue for the second quarter ended June 30 was $1.11 billion, an increase of 13% from the prior-year quarter. The figure missed analyst expectations of $1.14 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
<p>Recent privacy changes on iPhones, macroeconomic challenges and increasing competition for advertising dollars all contributed to "substantially slowed" revenue growth, Snap said.</p>
<p>The Santa Monica, California-based company said it intended to significantly slow hiring, invest in its advertising business and find new sources of revenue, in order to grow at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Daily active users on Snapchat rose 18% year-over-year to 347 million, beating consensus estimates of 344 million users.</p>
<p>Snap said revenue so far in the current third quarter is flat compared with the prior year, but did not provide revenue guidance because "forward-looking visibility remains incredibly challenging."</p>
<p>Investors are expecting the slowest-ever pace of growth for social media ad revenue this year, as increasing competition from TikTok and Apple Inc in advertising could compound economic conditions.</p>
<p>Snap on Thursday also announced a share repurchase program of up to $500 million.</p>
