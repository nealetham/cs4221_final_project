<p>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 17 (Reuters) - India is eyeing $100 billion in annual foreign direct investment (FDI) "in the next few years", its IT minister said on Wednesday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to attract investors ahead of a reelection bid.</p>
<p>"We see 6-8% consistent growth rate over the next full decade, and this is based on a very clearly thought-out strategy. This strategy has four major engines," Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw also told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p>
<p>He listed the four engines as investment in infrastructure,- both physical and digital, lifting up those at the bottom pyramid of the population, boosting manufacturing, and simplifying processes underlying ease of doing business.</p>
<p>Foreign investors have bet big on India since Modi came to power in 2014, with the likes of Apple, Samsung, Kia, and Airbus expanding operations.</p>
<p>This investment has come despite criticism from some executives who say Modi's protectionist policies in sectors such as digital payments, manufacturing and e-commerce often promote local businesses to the disadvantage of foreign companies.</p>
<p>India attracted FDI inflows of $33 billion in the first six months of the current financial year that started in April 2023. It recorded FDI of $71 billion in the 2022-23 financial year.</p>
<p>India expects its economy to grow by 7.3% in this financial year, the highest rate of any of the major global economies, but it still has large numbers of unemployed young people - a key issue in the upcoming elections.</p>
<p>Vaishnaw compared hitting $100 billion with the inflows China attracted annually over more than a decade, adding investors now see India as the "most important investment destination".</p>
<p>Vaishnaw has been overseeing India's push to be a powerhouse in electronics manufacturing, a key plank of Modi's business agenda.</p>
<p>India is continuously engaging with Apple to boost that company's manufacturing and retail presence in the country, Vaishnaw said. India is currently estimated to account for about 12-14% of global iPhone shipments.</p>
