<p>TAIPEI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and a major supplier for Apple, said on Tuesday revenue in August fell 8% year-on-year but forecast a better business outlook ahead of new product releases by major customer Apple.</p>
<p>Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said revenue last month reached T$412.83 billion ($12.93 billion), down 12% from July.</p>
<p>Revenue in its smart consumer electronics products, including smartphones, declined in August on the year due to "customers' conservative pull-in", the company said in a statement without elaborating.</p>
<p>Summer is traditionally a busy time for Foxconn as major vendors such as Apple gear up for new product launches ahead of the end-of-year holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>"With the second half of the year peak season currently underway, operations will gradually ramp up," Foxconn said.</p>
<p>"The outlook for the third quarter, which will be better than the second quarter, is expected to increase at an on-quarter pace higher than the average level of the previous two years."</p>
<p>Apple will host its fall event on Sept. 12, setting the stage for what analysts believe will be the unveiling of a new line of iPhones and smartwatches.</p>
<p>Other businesses, including computing products such as PCs and cloud and networking products, declined from a year ago, Foxconn said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>Foxconn beat estimates for second-quarter earnings unveiled last month thanks to a booming artificial intelligence sector but it retained a cautious outlook for this year due to global economic uncertainties.</p>
<p>The company downgraded its outlook for full-year revenue to a slight decline from a previous guidance of flat as it joined other companies grappling with a weak global economy and a sluggish recovery in China.</p>
