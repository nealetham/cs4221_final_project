<h1>Apple quarterly profit, revenue top Wall Street targets but China lags</h1>

</p>
<p>Feb 1 (Reuters) - Apple on Thursday reported sales and profit that beat Wall Street estimates, powered by growth in its iPhone business. But China sales missed analysts' targets.</p>
<p>The 2% rise in overall fiscal first-quarter sales for the company ended four straight quarters of sales declines on the strength of its iPhone 15 lineup, which includes devices capable of capturing three-dimensional video for the Vision Pro headset being released this week. Apple's total installed base of devices hit 2.2 billion, up from 2 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>"We did feel good about the plus 6% for iPhone," Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters in an interview. "We had particularly strong double-digit growth on iPhone in emerging markets outside of China. The iPhone is doing well in those markets."</p>
<p>He added: "China is the most competitive smartphone market in the world, and that hasn't changed."</p>
<p>For its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30, Apple reported sales of $119.58 billion and profit of $2.18 per share, both above analyst expectations of $117.91 billion and $2.10 per share, according to data from LSEG.</p>
<p>Sales of iPhones hit $69.70 billion, growing 6% to beat analyst expectations of $67.82 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
<p>Microsoft in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the artificial-intelligence race between Wall Street's tech heavyweights. Apple's stock has dropped more than 3% in 2024, compared with the S&amp;P 500's 2% increase.</p>
<p>Apple has said it is researching generative AI but has instead focused on its Vision Pro headset, which analysts do not expect to bring meaningful revenue for several years.</p>
<p>In the shorter term, analysts are increasingly worrying about sales of Apple's signature device in China, whose economy is navigating the burst of a real estate bubble. The iPhone also faces increasing competition in China and has fallen out of favor in government offices.</p>
<p>Apple said sales in China were $20.82 billion, missing analyst estimates of $23.53 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
<p>Cook told Reuters that, when accounting for currency exchange rates, iPhone sales in mainland China were down "mid-single digits" in the quarter but said the company's installed base of iPhones in China is at an all-time high.</p>
<p>Counterpoint Research reported China iPhone unit shipments fell during the quarter, with Chinese consumers looking to novel folding phones and homegrown rival Huawei, which re-entered the market with a flagship phone powered by a Chinese-made chip.</p>
<p>In the rest of Asia beyond China and Japan, Apple's sales hit $10.16 billion, above analyst estimates of $9.75 billion, according to LSEG data. Cook said that iPhone sales hit an all-time high in South Korea, home to Apple's longtime rival Samsung Electronics.</p>
<p>Investors will be listening closely for the Cupertino, California-based company's forecast for the fiscal second quarter on a conference call at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT).</p>
<p>The biggest growth area for Apple during its fiscal first quarter was its services business, which includes the Apple TV+ service as well as music, iCloud storage and the App Store, and which rose 11% to $23.12 billion in sales. The results were slightly below analyst expectations of $23.35 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
<p>But Apple's App Store faces a challenge in Europe, where a new law that takes effect in March will allow developers to skip paying commissions to Apple and place alternative app stores on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple's first-quarter Mac sales were up slightly to $7.78 billion, in line with analyst expectations of $7.73 billion, according to LSEG data. Sales of iPads were down 25% to $7.02 billion, missing expectations of $7.33 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
<p>Apple's wearables segment, which includes its AirPods and Apple Watch sales, fell to $11.95 billion after company executives had warned of weak demand. The results were just above expectations of $11.56 billion, according to LSEG data.</p>
<p>Several Apple Watch models have been at the center of a legal dispute with medical device maker Masimo and were briefly pulled from shelves before Apple removed a blood-oxygen monitoring features to comply with legal rulings and keep selling the devices.
