<h2>Will Tesla Ever Pay A Dividend?</h2>

<div class="post">
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Updated on November 14th, 2024 by Bob Ciura<br/>
</em></p>
<p>The appeal of growth stocks is that they have the potential for huge returns. Consider the massive rally by Tesla, Inc. (TSLA); in the past five years, the stock has generated total returns <em>over 1,000%</em>.</p>
<p>That’s a lifetime of returns for some investors; Tesla has done this in a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p>The downside of growth stocks is that volatility can work both ways. Also, growth stocks can generate strong returns but also carry the burden of high expectations due to their sky-high valuations.</p>
<p>Right now, Tesla does not pay a dividend to shareholders. As a result, we believe income investors looking for lower volatility should consider high-quality dividend growth stocks.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.suredividend.com/dividend-aristocrats-list/">Dividend Aristocrats</a> are a group of 66 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Index with 25+ consecutive years of dividend growth. You can download an Excel spreadsheet of all 66 (with metrics that matter, such as dividend yield and P/E ratios) by clicking the link below:</p>

<p>Over time, any company – even Tesla – could make the decision to start paying dividends to shareholders if it becomes sufficiently profitable.</p>
<p>In the past decade, other technology companies, such as Apple, Inc. (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), have initiated quarterly dividends.</p>
<p>These were once rapidly growing stocks that matured, and Tesla could follow the same way one day.</p>
<p>However, the ability of a company to pay a dividend depends on its business model, growth prospects, and financial position.</p>
<p>Even with Tesla’s huge run-up in share price, whether a company can pay a dividend depends on the underlying fundamentals.</p>
<p>While many growth stocks have made the transition to dividend stocks in recent years, it is doubtful that Tesla will join the ranks of dividend-paying stocks any time soon.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Business Overview</strong></h3>
<p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The company started out as a fledgling electric car maker, but has grown at an extremely high rate in the past several years. Tesla’s current market capitalization is above $700 billion, making it a mega-cap stock.</p>
<p>Amazingly, Tesla’s current market capitalization is more than <em>seven times</em> the combined market caps of auto industry peers Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM).</p>
<p>Tesla has a growing lineup of different models and price points and is looking into expanding that lineup further to become a full-line automaker.</p>
<p>Since going public in 2010 at a split-adjusted price of just $1.13 per share, Tesla has produced almost unbelievable returns for shareholders in hopes of massive future growth, as well as tremendous growth that has already been achieved.</p>
<p>Since then, it has grown into the leader in electric vehicles and business operations in renewable energy. Tesla produced about $96.7 billion in revenue in 2023.</p>
<p>In October, the company reported <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-releases-third-quarter-2024-financial-results">third-quarter</a> adjusted earnings-per-share of $0.72 which beat analyst estimates by $0.12. Revenue of $25.18 billion missed estimates by about $260 million, and represented year-over-year growth of 8%.</p>
<p>Adjusted earnings-per-share increased 9% year-over-year as operating margin expanded by 323 basis points from the same quarter last year. Tesla generated free cash flow of $2.742 billion for the third quarter.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Growth Prospects</strong></h3>
<p>Tesla’s primary growth catalyst is to expand sales of its core product line, and generate growth from new vehicles. The company’s S/X platform, which gave it the first bout of solid growth, but Tesla is now focused on ramping up its 3/Y platform.</p>
<p>Indeed, the 3/Y platform accounted for 95% of all deliveries last quarter.</p>
<p>In addition, Tesla is continuing to develop new models, with a pickup truck, a semi-truck, and even a cheaper, more attainable model than the 3.</p>
<p>The company has begun delivering its semi-truck as production of that new vehicle begins to ramp up. It will be some time before that’s a meaningful source of revenue, but it’s a totally new product line that could boost revenue growth.</p>
<p>Tesla is also ramping up vehicle production. It now operates “Gigafactories” in Nevada, New York, Texas, Germany, and China, with more to come to support rising demand.</p>
<p>Tesla’s competitive advantage stems mainly from its best-in-class software and other technologies, including full self-driving mode.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-70431" data-lazy-src="https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Technology-e1731619787611.png" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="383" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20710%20383'%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="710"/><noscript><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-70431" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" height="383" src="https://www.suredividend.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TSLA-Technology-e1731619787611.png" width="710"/></noscript></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q3-2024-Update.pdf">Investor Update</a></p>
<p>Tesla’s revenue growth has been very strong in the recent past. It grew revenue at an annual rate of 35% in the five-year period from 2018-2023. That level of growth is difficult to find, which is why Tesla’s shares have performed so well.</p>
<p>Whether Tesla can continue to maintain its high growth rate is another question.</p>
<p>Such a strong growth rate bodes well for the company’s future potential. Some investors may view the guidance of Tesla as too aggressive, but we note that electric vehicle sales are growing at a high rate. Electric vehicles are the clear path forward for automobiles, and Tesla is the leader in the space.</p>
<p>In addition, more than any other automaker, Tesla has delivered outstanding growth year after year. With an expanding product line, we believe the growth outlook for the company is bright.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Will Tesla Pay A Dividend?</strong></h3>
<p>Tesla has experienced rapid growth of shipment volumes and revenue in the past several years. But ultimately, a company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders also requires sustained earnings growth.</p>
<p>While Tesla has been the epitome of a growth stock through its top-line growth and huge share price gains, its profitability is still small in relation to its market cap. TSLA stock is currently trading at more than 100 times its <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/earnings">expected</a> 2024 EPS of $1.79.</p>
<p>Without reaching consistent profitability, a company cannot pay dividends to its shareholders.</p>
<p>Tesla lost money since it became publicly traded back in 2010, up until 2020. It goes without saying that a money-losing company needs to raise capital to continue to fund operations.</p>
<p>To that end, Tesla has sold shares and issued debt to cover losses and fund expansion in recent years, both of which make paying a dividend even more difficult.</p>
<p>However, since 2020, Tesla has rapidly expanded its profitability and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828024002390/tsla-20231231.htm#i605b1b87e9dd4fc1a8af0ddafef749a2_76">produced</a> $15 billion in net income in 2023. The company also generates positive free cash flow, making it easier to service its debt obligations and avoid future dilutive share issuances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company does not pay any net interest expense, as its interest income exceeds its interest expense.</p>
<p>We see the improvement in profitability and free cash flow, as well as the improved balance sheet, as supportive of the company’s ability to eventually pay a dividend.</p>
<p>However, Tesla is still very much in high-growth mode, and we expect any dividend that may be paid to be many years away. In other words, it is much more profitable for Tesla to reinvest its earnings in its business than to distribute it to shareholders.</p>
<p>Even if Tesla decided to initiate a dividend, it would likely be very low.</p>
<p>For instance, if Tesla were to distribute 30% of its expected 2024 EPS in the form of dividends (a standard payout ratio for growth stocks that pay dividends), the stock would only yield ~0.3%.</p>
<p>Such a yield will be immaterial for the shareholders, but the dividend would deprive the company of cash that could be utilized for higher-return growth projects.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tesla’s Stock Dividend</strong></h3>
<p>Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, said <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/28/tesla-wants-to-split-its-stock-so-it-can-pay-a-stock-dividend-shares-gain.html">in early 2022,</a> that he wants Tesla to “increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock … in order to enable a stock split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend.”</p>
<p>Essentially, a stock dividend is where a company splits its stock, and the impact on shareholders is that the company’s value doesn’t change, but the share price is lower because there are more outstanding shares.</p>
<p>Indeed, Tesla implemented a 3-for-1 split on its stock, which came into force on August 25th, 2022. As a result, its outstanding share count rose from 1.155 billion to 3.465 billion post-stock dividends, and the stock price adjusted from about $900 before the split to about $300.</p>
<p>A stock dividend is not necessarily a material event for shareholders because their relative stake in the company remains the same; they have more shares at a lower price.</p>
<p>However, investors tend to view stock dividends and splits as bullish events; thus, stock dividends can trigger rallies in the share price.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>
<p>Tesla is one of the premier growth stocks in the stock market. Shareholders who had the foresight to buy Tesla in its early years have been rewarded with enormous returns through a soaring share price.</p>
<p>However, investors looking for dividends and safety over the long run should probably continue to take a pass on Tesla stock. The company seems committed to using all the cash flow at its disposal to improve its operations’ profitability and invest in growth initiatives.</p>
<p>While there is always a possibility that Tesla’s massive share price rally could regain steam, it is also possible that the stock could fall. Investors should remember that volatility can work both ways.</p>
<p>More defensive investors, such as retirees, who are primarily concerned with protecting principal and dividend income, should instead focus on high-quality dividend growth stocks, such as the Dividend Aristocrats. It is unlikely that Tesla will ever pay a dividend, or at least not for many years.</p>
