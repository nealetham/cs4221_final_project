<p>NEW YORK--(<span itemid="https://www.businesswire.com" itemprop="provider publisher copyrightHolder" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="https://schema.org/Organization"><span itemprop="name"><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/" itemprop="url" referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" rel="nofollow">BUSINESS WIRE</a></span></span>)--Crackle Plus, a Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (Nasdaq: CSSE) company and the operator of streaming advertising-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) services Crackle and Popcornflix, today announced a new slate of original and exclusive programming during its NewFronts presentation.
</p>
<blockquote><p id="pull-quote"></p></blockquote>
<p>Based on viewers’ feedback and the success of recent Crackle originals, Crackle Plus unveiled close to 200 hours of new Crackle original and exclusive programming, with a diverse mix of original sports docuseries, scripted series, feature films and unscripted programming, aiming to offer both content that entertains and content that empowers and inspires its viewers. As part of Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Crackle Plus uniquely sources its original content from sister companies Screen Media, a leading content distribution company, and Landmark Studio Group, a production company of premium scripted and unscripted content.</p>
<p>“Since introducing Crackle Plus one year ago, we have made incredible strides to become a leading AVOD platform when it comes to original programming,” said Philippe Guelton, president of Crackle Plus. “Our unprecedented growth is driven by programming that engages audiences and provides exciting opportunities for advertising partners.”</p>
<p>Crackle Plus has doubled its content offerings since May 2019 and experienced approximately 40% audience growth since it began to introduce original and exclusive programming in October of 2019. At NewFronts, Crackle Plus shared its plans to develop and produce new and returning original series and feature films including:</p>

In her search for the truth, Emma and John soon become allies as they work together to try and stop a skilled, ruthless, and formidable enemy before it’s too late for the country...and themselves.
