<p>We are still waiting for the release of the iPhone 16 series, but in the meantime we already have the first rumors of the iPhone 17 series. Notable among them is that these devices would get 12 GB of RAM, a substantial upgrade compared to their predecessors. This upgrade should make the iPhone 17-series even more ready for all the capabilities of Apple Intelligence.</p>
<p>Apple introduced Apple Intelligence in early June at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). This is a set of promising AI features that will be available on iPhones in the future. Of the current iPhones on the market, Apple Intelligence is only coming to the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. The reason is that these devices have 8 GB of RAM, the minimum required to use the AI features. For that reason, the full iPhone 16 series, which is coming soon, will also have 8 GB of RAM, as will the iPhone SE 4, which is coming in 2025.</p>
<p>12 GB RAM in iPhone 17-series</p>
<p>According to user Phone Chip Expert on Weibo, via MacRumors, however, 8 GB is still not optimal to use Apple Intelligence. "Thereby, most AU processing should be performed in the cloud and not on your iPhone itself," it sounds.</p>
<p>The user therefore recommends waiting until the release of the iPhone 17 series. That way you will really be able to take full advantage of Apple Intelligence. After all, those devices would all get 12 GB of RAM. With that, even complex AI stuff can be performed on your iPhone itself. That has advantages in terms of consumption and privacy.</p>
