<p>At reader request, I’ve added this daily chart. The data is the John Hopkins CSSE data. <a href="http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Here is the site</a>. The three main poles of our multipolar world:</p>

<p>If you’re asking which political system took better care of its citizens, and working class, in particular — China, Europe, or the United States — it’s not hard question to answer, is It? I hold no brief whatever for the CCP, and believe them to be as incapble of <del><em>nobless oblige</em></del> simple human decency as our own ruling class, and therefore I’d speculate that the balance of class power is different; China’s elites fear their working class in a way that United States elites do not.</p>
<p>AZ: “Fewer than 200 ICU beds available in Arizona as state reports more than 60,000 coronavirus cases” [<a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/state/fewer-than-200-icu-beds-available-in-arizona-as-state-reports-more-than-60-000-coronavirus-cases" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ABC15</a>]. “There are 198 Adult Intensive Care Unit beds available in the state, or 12%, as of Wednesday, state data shows. There are currently 1,495 ICU beds, or 88%, in use.”</p>
<p>FL: “Florida has less than 25% of its ICU beds available, state data shows” [<a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/06/18/florida-has-less-than-25-of-its-icu-beds-available/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">News4Jax</a>]. “<a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/2020/06/18/nearly-12-of-duval-countys-covid-19-cases-reported-in-last-3-days/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Florida is currently seeing a surge in new coronavirus cases</a> with the state’s <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/2020/06/17/another-record-day-of-coronavirus-cases-reported-in-duval-county/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">seven highest daily increases</a> since the pandemic began coming in the last week.

In fact, a Jacksonville doctor told News4Jax on Wednesday that — at least locally — most of the patients coming to the hospital with COVID-19 right now aren’t showing severe symptoms that require ventilators.” • OTOH, <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/coronavirus/fl-ne-coronavirus-icu-bed-reporting-rules-change-20200623-dmf4p5nf3few5mvjvh53vixewm-story.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">it looks like the State is gaming the capacity figures</a>.</p>

<p>“With technology” sounds like a <em>deus ex machina</em> to me (or, to put it less kindly, “And then, a miracle occurs!” That doesn’t mean I think the situation is hopeless; just what’s worked has been well-understood public heatlh thinking dating back to the Victorian era, not shiny toys. That, and doctors and nurses fighting through cases to learn which treatments work.)</p>
<p><strong>Politics</strong></p>
<p>“But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?” –James Madison, Federalist 51</p>
<p>“They had one weapon left and both knew it: treachery.” –Frank Herbert, Dune</p>
<p>“They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing.” –Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord</p>
<p>Since we’re getting closer to the election, maybe it’s time to start looking at the electoral map. As of June 21: NPR and U.S. News forecasts added. Lots of new polls. And get so far the consensus remains the same.</p>

<p>So, taking the consensus as a given, 270 (total) – 204 (Trump’s) = 66. Trump must win 66 from the states in play: AZ (11), FL (29), MI (16), NC (15), PA (20), and WI (10) plus 1 to win not tie = 102. 102 – 66 = 36. So if Trump wins FL, MI, NC, and PA (29 + 16 + 15 + 20 = 80), he wins. That’s a heavy lift. I think I’ve got the math right this time!</p>

<p>Biden (D)(1): “Dems warm to Biden’s bunker strategy” [<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/24/dems-warm-to-bidens-bunker-strategy-338853" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Politico</a>]. “In the three months Biden launched his stay-at-home campaign from his cellar TV studio, his lead has grown to double-digits in national polls while Trump has pinballed from crisis to crisis. While the president’s approval ratings have suffered under the weight of Trump’s handling of the pandemic, an economic recession and protests over racism and police brutality, Biden just posted his widest lead yet — 14 percentage points, according to a New York Times/Siena poll released Wednesday. ‘Trump is running against Trump. And it’s smart of Biden to not get in the way of that,’ Hilary Rosen, a consulting partner of top Biden adviser Anita Dunn, said in echoing the sentiment in the campaign. ‘It’s become a referendum on Trump’s behavior.’ Democrats who were once alarmed that Biden needed to do more are suddenly perfectly happy with a schedule that keeps him as close as possible to his Wilmington, Del., home most days. Only recently has he begun to make forays beyond his own neighborhood.” • The beauty part of a Democrat running and winning as Not Trump™ is that they make no policy commitments. To voters, I mean. Not donors.</p>
<p>UPDATE Biden (D)(2): “Blackstone’s Tony James Hosts Fundraiser for Biden” [<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-24/blackstone-s-tony-james-hosts-high-dollar-fundraiser-for-biden" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>]. “Blackstone Group Inc. Executive Vice Chairman Tony James hosted a small, high-dollar fundraiser for Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Wednesday. James and his wife, Amabel, led the virtual event for 30 donors with Biden, who’s been appearing nearly daily at fundraisers before the end of the quarter next week. Biden has been seeking to balance his efforts to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for his campaign from wealthy donors with the policy concerns of progressives who hope to see him enact tough rules on Wall Street if elected… ‘We’ve got to bring it back, we’ve got to rebuild the middle class and this time we’ve got to bring everybody along. Everybody of color. Those with disabilities. We’ve got to bring them all along. When we do, everybody’s better off,’ he said. ‘We can all win together,’ James responded.” • Wut:</p>

His approval numbers declined through 2017, as he ended his first year under 40 percent, but through 2018 and 2019 they gradually ticked up to the mid-40s. Apart from that modest ebb and flow, his numbers just didn’t move. Even in the early stages of the coronavirus crisis and the economy going off a cliff, his numbers were frozen in place. But starting about the beginning of April, seven weeks before George Floyd’s tragic death in Minneapolis under the knee of a police officer, Trump’s approval rating started declining. His RealClearPolitics average peaked on March 30 at 47 percent with a 50 percent disapproval; as of Monday afternoon, his approval stood at 42 percent, with 55 percent disapproving. When matched up with Joe Biden, Trump typically trailed by about 5 or 6 points. At the end of March, the numbers started oscillating, as undecideds jumped from about 5 percent to 12 percent of the electorate. Then, beginning two weeks ago, about five days after Floyd’s death, a new pattern set in. Now the RCP average shows an 8-point lead for Biden. If we look at only live telephone interview surveys, his lead swells to about 10 points.”</p>
<p>Trump (R)(2): “This is the best American policy in 50 years” [Ryan Cooper, <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/921480/best-american-policy-50-years" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Week</a>]. “he United States is in the pit of the deepest recession since the 1930s. And yet, a <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/new-poverty-measure-confirms-coronavirus-driven-federal-stimulus-measures-were" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent study</a> from the University of Chicago using Census data found that the poverty rate actually decreased from 10.9 percent in early 2020 to 8.6 percent in April and May. That’s not just unusual and highly welcome, it is the lowest rate ever recorded since the government began keeping <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official poverty figures</a> in the 1960s. The reason is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/us/politics/coronavirus-poverty.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">two parts</a> of the CARES Act, passed back in March: the one-off economic rescue payment (which gave $1,200 to most individuals, and $500 to children) and the huge expansion of unemployment benefits. Despite ongoing administrative difficulties, these programs are certainly the most progressive policy America has seen in over half a century — nothing else since Medicare, Medicaid, and various civil rights laws from the mid-1960s can compare in impact.” • Now, that doesn’t mean these programs will persist. However, it’s worth nothing that the CARES Act — with Orange Hitler in the Oval Office, and a Republican Senate — has been far more effective in relieving suffering for the working class than Obama’s miserably inadequate response to the Crash of ~2008 and the subseqent foreclosure crisis, when Democrat held the House and the Senate, and Obama was the greatest orator of our time and the next FDR. <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/margaret_thatcher_141748" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">It’s a funny old world</a>.</p>

The race remains too close to call, NBC News projects. The current tally includes only votes cast in person at the polls on Tuesday. Hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots that will likely determine the outcome of the race have not yet been counted and will not be for days.” • So Booker edges ahead due to his late surge. Now we get to see how many voters the DNC suckered into early voting for McGrath. Still, good news in my book. If Booker wins, that would be <em>truly</em> seismic.</p>

But their latest attempt – a new proposal called the ‘Great Reset’ – is the most ambitious and radical plan the world has seen in more than a generation. At a virtual meeting earlier in June hosted by the World Economic Forum, some of the planet’s most powerful business leaders, government officials and activists announced a proposal to ‘reset’ the global economy. Instead of traditional capitalism, the high-profile group said the world should adopt more socialistic policies, such as wealth taxes, additional regulations and massive Green New Deal-like government programs. ‘Every country, from the United States to China, must participate, and every industry, from oil and gas to tech, must be transformed,’ wrote Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, in an article published on WEF’s website. ‘In short, we need a ‘Great Reset’ of capitalism.’ Schwab also said that ‘all aspects of our societies and economies’ must be ‘revamped,’ ‘from education to social contracts and working conditions.’ Joining Schwab at the WEF event was Prince Charles, one of the primary proponents of the Great Reset; Gina Gopinath, the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund; António Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations; and CEOs and presidents of major international corporations, such as Microsoft and BP. <ins>Activists from groups such as Greenpeace International and a variety of academics also attended the event or have expressed their support for the Great Reset</ins>.” • No wonder the reaction to Michael Moore’s <em>Planet of the Humans</em> was so vicious…. </p>

Fighting through the anti-Trump ranting, we come to this: “U.S. institutions were vulnerable to Trump’s attack because public trust had been quietly ebbing away from them for some time… The financial crisis of 2008, and the subsequent bailout for banks, only accelerated the trend toward inequality and deepened distrust in Congress, the judiciary, the Federal Reserve, and regulatory agencies. To regain that trust, the next administration must confront endemic racism as well as economic inequality. <ins>Good jobs must once again be on offer for most Americans—even those without college degrees</ins>. Redressing these wrongs will go a long way toward restoring faith in American democratic institutions. But the next administration must also redouble its commitment to bureaucratic expertise, competence, and autonomy. Institutions don’t merit public trust if they serve the interests of the president or other politicians instead of the interests of the people. Americans deserve better. One hopes they will use the ballot box, and if necessary the streets, to make sure that they get better.” • “Once again”? </p>

<p>Tech: “Apple Inc.’s decision to insource its semiconductors is raising big questions for the electronics giant’s suppliers. Apple is breaking off a 15-year agreement with chip supplier Intel Corp. as part of a broader strategy to replace third-party parts with components designed in house…. Apple’s drive toward its own custom components may have harsh repercussions for the broad eco-system of technology parts makers” [<a href="https://logistics.cmail20.com/t/ViewEmail/d/BCA72225E5F1A81F2540EF23F30FEDED/74809B9BE512E20BCE63909E3969C05F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a>]. “Several supply Apple even as they fear the company will start making the components they produce. That’s a concern at the heart of many supplier-buyer pacts, but Apple’s scale and the high value of tech components make it a matter of survival for many companies. Tech manufacturers Imagination Technologies and Dialog Semiconductor were staggered by earlier Apple insourcing decisions. Such moves give Apple greater control over its components, however, and can reduce costs by eliminating a link in the supply chain.” • Shows you why “ecosystem” was always a terrible metaphor; after all, a panda doesn’t decide one day to in-source its bamboo.</p>

Readers within the Post newsroom were asking the question, too. ‘No one I’ve spoken with at the Post can figure out why we published this story,’ said one prominent reporter at the paper. ‘We blew up this woman’s life for no reason.’…. The Post said Schafer’s transgression was news because it happened in front of Toles and somewhere possibly in the vicinity of columnist Dana Milbank.” • “Somewhere possibly in the vicinity of Dana Milbank…</p>

In March, she also found herself without a home so she started living in her minivan on the streets of Portland, Ore. For the past few months, Lavon has been keeping an audio diary of her experience being newly homeless. Her first night living in her car, Lavon didn’t know where to park and feel safe. She drove around and found a road in an industrial area on the west side of Portland’s airport. <ins>The road is lined on both sides with people living in their cars, RVs and trailers. Many look as if they have been parked there a long time: They have awnings and furniture set up.</ins> Lavon parks alongside them each night, and although she doesn’t interact with her neighbors much, she says she feels there’s safety in numbers….. Lavon has struggled with housing instability since she was a kid. She grew up with a single mom who worked multiple jobs, and they moved around a lot. ‘I’m just one of those people that’s always on the move, not always willingly,’ Lavon says. ‘That’s just how my life has gone.'” • Just let me take a moment to find one of the Tweets produced by The Biden™’s Platitude Generator: </p>

<h2>About Lambert Strether</h2>
<p>Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.</p>

<p>EROEI on the uranium fuel cycle has been figured anywhere from 1:1 to 90:1 depending on where one draws the system boundaries. One study by researchers in the industry conservatively but cursorily estimates 5:1.</p>
<p>My impression of most of the mainstream “conversation” about the manufactured “issue” is that it’s calculated to avoid talking about subjects uncomfortable for vested interests, such as alternative fuel cycles that don’t require crony capitalism to work.</p>

<p>If we’d competently invested in it, lots of R&amp;D etc., it would probably look a lot better. It’s not like some older reactor designs (CANDU) don’t offer major risk advantages if the concern is meltdown. And those were first built in the 70s. But oil is cheap…</p>
<p>I think the relevant comparison is subway systems – if you keep building them and retain the competencies of the people doing the work, you can improve over time. Instead we like to start from scratch every 20 years.</p>

<p>“Reset of the global economy”. This is the term I’ve used explaining to friends why “return to normal” is language used in order to keep the frogs in the boiling pot.<br/>
Other sedating language: “V” shaped recovery.</p>
<p>But none of the men in that meeting will feel the heat from the fallout of their sure to be inequitable and dystopian reset.  Like Charles Hug Smith wrote  in the article posted on NC last week: “For the Rich to Keep Getting Richer, We Have to Sacrifice Everything Else.” Everyone in that room is interested only in maintaining their massive wealth.<br/>
They pay the politicians dearly to step up and take the heat.<br/>
Whatever is not liked about the oligarchs’ reset is already all the “gubment’s” fault – never the oligarchs who are their true constituency.  Then they use the divisiveness of policy, elections, and the MSM to keep the pleebs fighting among themselves.</p>

<p>Re uranium: Good point, though I’m still partial to nuclear power as possibly the dominant means to beat climate change. But I’d still like to see some reckoning of the power downsides you mention for uranium, as well as similar numbers for various other energy sources.</p>
<p>Fifty years into this environmental emergency you’d think everyone would have solid, proven figures of this sort at their fingertips.</p>

<p>If you read through the article you find two things: First, according to the piece the plan is World Economic Forum types who are relying on armies of “Left Wing” troops to enact their change and that this will be nefarious. Second, the author is from the Heartland Institute funded by the Koch’s.</p>
<p>Notably the “article” (really a hit piece) omits any discussion of what is actually being proposed or how it would work. Instead the goal seems to be to link the Davos set directly to the left-wing mobs attacking America, to … Prince Charles, in a global conspiracy to take over. This sounds more like Agenda 21 and less like an actual functional conspiracy.</p>
<p>That said I am sure any attempt to “reset” along the lines defined by Schwartzman or any of the people who get invited to Davos will be bad for actual people but I don’t think the author of this piece exactly has our best interests at heart.</p>

<section class="comment-content comment">
<p>The antagonism of the political left towards nuclear energy is troublesome, particularly on how there are reactor types that address all of the usual issues that are raised about nuclear energy and they have existed for decades. There is also the fact that many on the left, particularly the “liberal” left (Karens) seem to be the largest component of the anti-vaxxer movement in many developed countries. As left as I am on the political spectrum I am more than aware there is also plenty of pseudoscience to be found on the political left as well as the political right.</p>
<p>In any case, I think that propaganda from “liberal” corporate sources is more dangerous since many people still think that Democrats=political left as well as the media at large. So people who identify as rank-and-file Democrat are not as likely to recognize just how corporate-friendly the media they watch and their party is. I mean, at a passing glance it is evident that Obama was nothing more than a center-right neoliberal, yet he is still seen as a champion of social freedom and good governance by the populace at large in retrospect.</p>

<p>Good points but can we maintain the current and anticipated world population that expects a high energy air conditioned future on renewable energy? I spent years living in the Mojave desert trying to figure out a renewable way to keep cool. I tried wind, solar, evaporative. In the end I had to break down and get a gas generator running a swamp cooler which was cooling the coils of an air conditioner that was also running off the generator. I don”t think the Mojave was any different than Rajastan or most of Afghanistan, which I have visited on a few occasions as a guest. So how do we get the big loads of power that will enable us to air condition, for example, Pakistan or Palestine?</p>

<p>Nope, we can’t maintain. We are going to have to learn to use less.</p>
<p>If AC is an absolute requirement for some places, they’ll just have to figure out a way to allocate the power. Just because we’re heating the planet like nobody’s business doesn’t mean we should jump to solutions where the fix ends up worse than the problem it was fixing. We have a nasty tendency to do that though, so I’m not holding my breath.</p>

<p>aside from Thorium, I’m pretty agnostic on nuclear power. I have family history with workers on the South Texas Nuclear Project, and am therefore not at all sanguine about quality control, etc at such facilities.<br/>
as for the rest…yup.<br/>
stepdad, if sufficiently in his cups when we eat over there, will alway…always…end up asking me why i won’t vote Biden.<br/>
My response is pretty canned, by now, and wouldn’t surprise anyone here.<br/>
But both him and mom still insist that Obama was the best president evah…and as progressive and well meaning in his baby steps towards socialist healthcare as anyone…<br/>
so…what are ya gonna do? lol<br/>
That age cohort in aggregate is likely a lost cause, as far as democratic socialism, or defunding the cops, or reining in the military and a whole lot of things goes.<br/>
a lot of that intransigence/inertia is where they get their news from. Msdnc is on both tv’s all day long…mom takes breaks with home and garden(which causes other domestic issues around here,lol) and stepdad takes breaks for gunsmoke and the like(and football, of course)<br/>
stepdad is afraid of computers, and mom gets her online news from Bing and Daily Kos, and is proud of her sophistication.<br/>
A lifetime of Cold War anticommie propaganda has also done it’s work…”socialism” is scary to them, even when i enumerate the benefits…and, indeed, how both of them have benefited from it already(VA and Tricare)<br/>
lead a horse to water, and he’ll stand there looking at ya.</p>

<p>Maybe you should tell your stepdad when he asks why you won’t vote for Biden something like this: <em>“It’s simple. If Biden was here in the room with us, you would quickly discover that not only do you have more integrity than Biden does, but he is losing his marbles and is not the man he once was.

<p>Even when Biden HAD all his marbles, the results weren’t good (the Clarence Thomas Hearings and the Iraq War Hearings he chaired are just two harmful and very consequential actions promoted by Biden).</p>

<p>“Called to Account does an excellent job of presenting the frauds as catalysts for the changes that have taken place in regulation, in accounting and auditing standards, and in accounting practice over the period from the early 1900s to the first part of the 21st century. The information about the frauds is presented in enough detail so that the reader can see why the fraud was successful. I recall Professor John Willingham saying a number of years ago that most partners and managers in public practice had not been involved in an audit where there had been a fraud and thus were not as well equipped as they might be to recognize a fraud at an audit client. Called to Account provides enough detail that the readers can easily imagine themselves in the picture and being required to make the decisions the auditor had to make.“</p>

<p>I played Team Fortress 2 as an Engineer, he builds auto cannons, ammo dispenser, teleporters etc. Engies are a gaming archetype, like spy or medic. If he is properly supported, mostly against spies yes, it can work, but you have to be vigilant. It’s a balance though, you need turtles to protect flags etc. but you need a front line to slow the advance or they overwhelm you. A good team knows their positions and know what types a particular team/map needs. It’s nuts, I got my GF to play it once and she said it was the most frenetic hour of her life.</p>
<p>EVE has Citadels, space castles, which have a siege mode IIRC, and some of the bigger ships do as well. It can take hours to wear those mothers down…</p>

<p>The price tag is 100 trillion in game credits, ISK, Inter Stellar Credits (Icelandic game), a billion ISK gets you 20$, so that Citadel will run you 20K$ real world….</p>

<p>that would depend entirely upon the game, would it not?</p>
<p>i can see variants of this strategy used commonly in MMOs. we used to call it “pulling to base” or somesuch. make the enemy enter a narrow room that you have locked down with your team, and wail on them at leisure.</p>
<p>in that instance, it fails usually because someone fell asleep or someone’s pull failed to weed properly down to the desired mob, sometimes called “too many adds”.</p>

<p>Camping is more focused on staying place in a spot. Usually a choke point, valuable resource, or high ground.</p>
<p>For example, hide/stealth at an area where lots of opposing players will come through (chokepoint, valuable resource, spawn points), then ambush attack.</p>
<p>My person favorite is a tower or mountain top where snipers usually hang out. Since they usually get too comfortable and oblivious, bring a buddy and just humiliatingly melee them.</p>

<p>I presume it depends on the strategy and opponents. Against AIs in 4X games, its really all you can do because the AI usually gets too many resources to simply beat by doing what the AI does. You can “min/max” to win, but it requires basically just clicking the buttons in a set pattern. Against people, its okay until you run into an aggressive player who knows “min/max” strategies. All you can do is hope the AI doesn’t have it out for you and attacks all at once.</p>
<p>The games also have bonuses which basically snow ball until you get to the end of the game where the AIs advantages are nullified in some fashion usually in game inflation.</p>
<p>Its best to just play for fun on lower levels such as emperor in the Civ series and have fun.</p>

<p>Depends on the game. But generally it is a viable strategy, if you can hole up around resources. It won’t win you a game by itself though; eventually your opponent(s) will get access to late-game, long range weapons that can obliterate your defenses from outside their defensive range. You *have* to have an army, you can’t just cower behind your walls forever.</p>

<p>Depends on the game. I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtling_(gameplay)" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia Turtling entry</a>.</p>
<p>In some games, the turtle is so your opponents go after easier targets – especially if the game mechanics make it very difficult to eliminate people employing the strategy.</p>
<p>In fighting games, the player plays in a defensive manner and plays keep away with quick/fast attacks and ranged attacks. This is usually a more beginner friendly style.</p>

<p>It’s generally done in the mid-game in order to build up forces for a decisive attack at the end, preferably after the enemy has smashed themselves against your defenses. The problem with the strategy is that it allows your enemy to build their own forces unmolested and they can generally afford to build superior forces because they’re not spending money on defenses. Not sure how this translates into politics</p>

<p>It helps form one of the classic rock-paper-scissors triangles in real time strategy games like Starcraft. Generally it’s strong against early aggression or all-out assault tactics, but weak against opponents that avoid confronting you directly and invest in expanding or teching up instead, in which case all your fortifications become a useless misallocation of resources and you fall way behind.</p>

The Press kept a count of days without Hillary appearing for an interview. Now Joe has the pandemic as an excuse to hide away.

<section class="comment-content comment">
<p>The term “turtle-ing” (I thought it was “turtling”, but whatever) is also used in Mixed Martial Arts. It refers to fighters curling up into a ball on elbows and knees, with forearms protecting the sides of the head. It is generally used by fighters who have sustained a blow rendering them unable to fight back, but not unconscious, and is essentially a way for the hurt fighter to limit the damage they sustain until the referee steps in to stop the fight, usually about 5-10 seconds later. Occasionally the hurt fighter will recover enough during this time for the referee to allow the fight to continue. It really is a brutal sport.</p>
<p>I’m guessing there’s a pretty good chance Biden will end up in the turtle position (figuratively speaking, of course) during one or more of the debates with Trump. Personally, I wouldn’t mind seeing the 2020 election being decided by a cage fight, after all Trump’s doctor has said he’s in perfect health and Biden was going around challenging people to push-up contests. I’d be rooting for a double KO (i.e. both knock each other out at the same time). It’s a very rare outcome but it does happen on occasion.</p>

<p>I read that the company just flat-out lied. The deposits weren’t “missing” they never existed, the two banks in the Philippines said they had never had an account for Wirecard. The company just fabricated the bank accounts and siphoned the money off somewhere else.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wirecard-accounts/wirecard-ceo-exits-as-search-for-missing-billions-hits-dead-end-in-asia-idUSKBN23Q0YA?il=0" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wirecard-accounts/wirecard-ceo-exits-as-search-for-missing-billions-hits-dead-end-in-asia-idUSKBN23Q0YA?il=0</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“The document claiming the existence of a Wirecard account with BDO is a falsified document and carries forged signatures of bank officers,” BDO said, adding that it had reported the matter to the Philippines’ central bank.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wirecard isn’t a victim here. This is fraud, plain and simple.</p>

<section class="comment-content comment">
<p>I agree completely. The unwinding of the Wirecard fraud has been fascinating to watch over the last week. I’ve been watching avidly from my daughter’s bedside as she recovers from a burst appendix.</p>
<p>I can’t help but draw some parallels between the two situations. The inflamed appendage festers quietly away until it eventually bursts, putting the wider body at grave risk unless skilled professionals recognise the danger and act quickly to excise the malign part and keep contagion at bay. Fortunately for my daughter the local public hospital staff were more than up to the task. I fear the German financial regulators are likely to be less competent.</p>
<p>Oh and thanks to having the foresight to be born in a country with a functional healthcare system we have no need to start a Go Fund Me appeal to cover the 20 odd dollars in parking fees the surgery and 6 days in hospital have cost us. As the late, great Fred Dag sang ‘We don’t know how lucky we are’ here in New Zealand.</p>

<p>A burst appendix? Yikes! I hope that she recovers quickly. Probably for her the only sign of this will be a small scar but the Wirecard fraud will still be unwinding.</p>

<p>Would those journalist be able to take legal action against the Regulator for making false accusations then? That is not a good story that. It means that the German government is giving, or trying to give, legal cover for Wirecards. But I suppose that after giving cover for Deutsche Bank, Wirecards would be a snap. The Germans deserve a better government here.</p>

<p>Kind of how it was designed. The goal was to keep people on the payroll until the virus passed. Then juice it up a little to give incentive to employers to bother with the hoops the govt puts out.</p>
<p>The alternative was to close early, which I recall a famous chain doing. The chef/owner figured it was best to get out early while he still had money, gave out final paychecks and would get back into the business when/if things got better. I think shutting the shop and laying everyone off early turned out to be the better idea.</p>

<p>careful with that, though…it’ll kill whatever bees are there..and bugs in general. breaks the waxy coating on them and allows dessication.<br/>
I use it on rare occasions i get aphids or spidermites. One drop in a regular handheld sprayer will do the truck.</p>
<p>for foliar fertiliser(fish emulsion is my hands-down favorite), spray when it’s dry, and no surfactant is necessary.<br/>
whatever falls off gets to the roots anyway.</p>
<p>whomever my feedstore gets their fish fertiliser from has apparently gone out of business, so i’m stuck with my homemade cow patty tea, which can be quite vile, if i leave it to steep too long.</p>

<p><i>Apple Inc.’s decision to insource its semiconductors …</i></p>
<p>I’d assume Apple is going to outsource its ARM chip designs to TSMC or some other foundry. There’s no guarantees on that one though and Apple certainly has the cash stockpile to set things up for themselves. Especially if they’ve identified that as being cost saving. That could potentially be pretty disruptive.</p>

<p>Ever since Apple went to Intel, Hackintoshes became a thing again (I remember some from the 90s). I still run Snow Leopard on a Hackintosh, because you can swap out individual parts easily if something goes wrong, and PC parts are much easier to find (new) than Apple parts for old machines. I also still run an i7 MBP from 2012, really the last model where you can easily swap the battery, replace the hard drive, upgrade the RAM, etc. It’s been 8 years, and still the newest models don’t blow mine out the water, because the new models basically have the same upgrades I’ve installed, and the processors aren’t getting significantly better.</p>
<p>Apple making their own chips would really lock their “ecosystem” down. They’ve already made their devices as unrepairable as possible, now they dump the Hackintoshes as well – it’s full systems control. This probably means that they’re preparing for a new generation of devices, because the odds are with a new non-Intel processor many of the current programs won’t work – everyone will be forced to upgrade. Similar to a decade ago, when the transition from Leopard to Snow Leopard to Lion obsoleted all the older machines in a space of, what, a couple of years?</p>

<p>I am locked in by my audio recording hardware. Even if I could afford to upgrade to high-quality hardware not specifically for Macs, I’m pretty sure at the moment I don’t want to spend the time to learn new recording software. I’m going to keep this machine alive until the bitter, bitter end. Or upgrading to one of the old model nuclear bunker Mac Pros that can run Snow Leopard. Used all the way for me.</p>
<p>Before I ever spend the money to upgrade the recording hardware, I’ll be diving into 8- and 16- tracks. Been doing more and more straight to tape. There’s just some things the computer interface is really good at handling.</p>

<p>ARM makes obvious sense for mobile but there’s a lot of interest in ARM at the data center level. If nothing else it has the promise of power consumption reduction and less cooling requirements. Both of which are steep costs if you have a few thousand DL360s.<br/>
Also, the new Mac Pro not withstanding Apple hasnt been all that welcoming of power users for a while.</p>

<p>I used to joke that Apple is trying to be a better Sony than Sony. It’s not a joke anymore.</p>
<p>Apple bought a semiconductor design team a while ago in an acquisition. They have enough talent in-house to create a system-on-chip for their new devices. (Hell, I did that while slumming it in retail years ago, and I dropped out of 11th grade.) They have also invested near-monumentally in compiler (Clang) and transpiler (LLVM) technologies, <em>and</em> have a proven track record of successfully migrating products to new platforms.</p>
<p>An instruction set architecture is just a convention specifying what the machine looks like to the programmer and what instruction bit patterns cause what changes in the state of the machine. Apple, being well-resourced and very prone to not-invented-here syndrome, doesn’t profit much from enforced fidelity to another woman’s ISA, especially when your cores, whether your code or theirs, are covenantually obligated to not even talk to the neighborhood women or unfamiliar co-processors except by standardized protocols. Apple engineers would doubtless chomp at the bit for the opportunity to make their processors “think different” right down to the machine code, helping lock people into their toolchains and slowing down the infosec community’s discovery and exposure of any security vulnerabilities that may exist.</p>
<p>(Oddly, Softbank, ARM’s owner, seems to be up a bit today.)</p>

<p>I stumbled on a Great Conjunction conspiracy theory the other day, also apparently known as the Tecumseh Curse. Saturn and Jupiter come together in our night sky once every ~20 years or so, and it turns out that occurrence hasn’t been great for sitting US presidents. The cycle was broken only by Reagan (who survived an assassination attempt) and Bush the Younger (one could argue the real power, Dick Cheney, also narrowly survived some health issues).</p>
<p>Anyways, not a good omen for Mr. Biden, but definitely a good one for his VP pick!</p>

<p>Reality can really suck as some of these politicians are finding out. Viruses and bacteria are apolitical and don’t study economic theory. They just exploit efficient reproductive environments which many politicians are bending over backwards to provide. I finished reading John Barry’s “The Great Influenza.’ Politicians and most of the populace have learned nothing over the past century despite massive advances of the medical understanding of what is going on. There are entire chapters of that book where you could substitute “coronavirus” for “influenza” and it would read like it was happening today.</p>
<p>BTW – NYC people are unaware that three-quarters of NYS even exists, so they never go east of Albany or Middleton in New York State. That is a key reason why much of upstate NY did not get hit hard – we were largely isolated from NYC, much more so than people along I-87 or I-95.</p>

<p>But how long can you keep people locked down? Look at the recent riots and looting scenes. I suspect this had more to do with people being out of work and confined than with racial injustice, which is more like an excuse to get out and wreak havoc. I believe politicians noticed this, too.</p>

<p>Upstate NY has quite a bit open, but everybody is quite respectful, wearing masks in public etc. Our numbers are going up a tiny bit, but not much.</p>
<p>This disease can be addressed fairly safely without great restrictions, but people need to follow common-sense rules, not just pretend that it doesn’t exist. Respect for others seems to be missing. I blame the political rhetoric around this disease for much of that. The sicence of it has been difficult enough, never mind when it is put into a political blender. somehow, avoiding Covid has also become realted to 2nd Amendment issues in some places? Baffling.</p>
<p>My big question is “How many people need to die or be disabled for politicians to be voted out of office”?.</p>

<p>At this time, there are no reported injuries or reports of missing individuals.</p>
<p>There were approximately 40 vehicles parked in the area. Vehicles were covered in dust, but there did not appear to be damaged. The Whitney Portal store was also covered in a blanket of dust. The Inyo National Forest has not begun issuing permits to hike Mt Whitney.</p>
<p>Aerial reconnaissance, as well as reports from hikers identified several additional slides; one directly above Lone Pine Lake, one about a quarter mile above Lone Pine Lake near the main trail, and three slides on the face of Mt. Whitney. It is unclear at this time if the Mt. Whitney trail has been damaged. Based on dust seen from the Owens Valley floor it appears that most canyons, including trailheads, south of Kearsarge Pass had at least minor rockslides triggered by yesterday’s earthquake.</p>
<p>Due to several smaller aftershocks throughout yesterday afternoon and evening, only a preliminary search could be conducted near the slide zone. After an evaluation by a US Forest Service geologist this morning, the intention is to send in search and rescue teams and canines to check each of the debris fields.</p>
<p>Today, if it safe, Inyo National Forest Wilderness Rangers will begin assessing if there is damage to the trail systems in the area. Yesterday’s initial assessment shows substantial damage to a section of the National Recreation Trail (that starts at Lone Pine Campground and ends in Whitney Portal). The focus today will be on the Mt. Whitney Trail. At this time, the Mt. Whitney Trail, The Meysan Lakes Trail, and the North Fork of Lone Pine Trail (Mountaineering Route) are closed until further notice. Permits for day and overnight summits of Mt. Whitney will continue be cancelled until further notice.</p></blockquote>

<p>The area is also a classic Hollywood movie location. See, for example, George Stevens’ 1939 Gunga Din.</p>
<p>I was there a few months ago on my Tour de Sierra. The gravel roads were dotted with govt land squatting RVs.</p>

<blockquote><p>China’s elites fear their working class in a way that United States elites do not.</p></blockquote>
<p>I disagree with this. I don’t think that they fear the working class. I think that they a) fear the class being unable to work (i.e. too sick to keep making them rich); and b) they do not hold the illusion that disease will stay contained to the class. I think they may also see a practical power advantage in controlling it better than Trump.</p>
<p>I think also that Xi Jinping personally fears his political enemies close to home. He has many and they want him gone.</p>
<p>Our own elites have long felt that the working class are not in any way connected to their own global wealth and so do not care.</p>

<section class="comment-content comment">
<p>The rulers of China know their history.  They know that any governing regime that sufficiently pisses off too many of the Chinese ruled finds a way to become an ex-governing regime.<br/>
They also know that invasion from the outside is one of the ways that that can happen.  Particularly, for the past 1000 years (which for China is only a fraction of their history), a unified China was ruled by a government of Chinese (not foreigners) for only a small fraction of the time.   One could even argue that the period since the founding of the PRC in 1949 is the only such period in the past millennium.<br/>
So they are wisely concerned by both permanent dangers.<br/>
If the virus situation in China and the US were reversed, the US government would most certainly be using this to reduce the power of the Chinese government and increase its own.<br/>
Evil totalitarians though they are, the Chinese directing class is a coherent force directing their nation.  The US directing class is more like foreign plunderers even within the US.</p>

<blockquote><p>OTOH, I’d argue that the success (at least in cultural terms) of the Sanders slogan #NotMeUs, as well as the protests generally, would indicate that matters are not nearly as bleak as this poll suggests.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really don’t see these points in conflict at all. I for one do believe that we live in a society where screwing people over is the way people get ahead. I have little faith in our institutions or the so called “moral values” that people preach to control that.</p>
<p>But I don’t <em>want it to be that way.</em></p>
<p>From this survey we can’t tell whether or not the other people believe that this is a desirable state of affairs we can only tell that they think it is the way of things now. If you believe that we are in a bad place, you are more apt to rally behind a message of change to make it better. If, on the other hand, you think that things are all good, or were before the nasty orange monster showed up, then you are apt to focus on returning to ‘normal’.</p>
<p>From this chart the election results make perfect sense to me. What I would want to see is whether that report that Dems are happy with Biden’s bunker antics break along similar age lines. I for one am growing less and less happy with him (not that I was before) the longer he focuses on flinging “orange man bad!” videos out the door and the less time he spends on giving a clear vision of actual future directions. But then again yes, he did promise that “nothing would change.”</p>

<p>That was kinda my take too: the poll reflected <em>situational</em> thinking, the slogan <em>aspirational</em> thinking.</p>
<p>Personally I suspect that what many of the youngsters meant (it seems true among the millennials and zoomers I work with) is that they <em>assume</em> people are bad until they prove otherwise. Which is still not great, but given the incentives in our society can you blame them?</p>

<blockquote><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee blocked an effort by Chairman Lindsey Graham to give the attorney general the power to veto investigations of Justice Department lawyers by the inspector general.</p>
<p>The committee instead backed — over the objections of Graham and Attorney General William Barr — a bipartisan bill by Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah that would empower the department’s inspector general to investigate such allegations on his own authority.</p>
<p>Graham said the attorney general, as the head of the Justice Department, should have discretion to overrule the agency watchdog in such cases. …</p>
<p>But his amendment was criticized by members of both parties, including former Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, the senior Republican in the Senate.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what the attorney general says on this IG thing,” Grassley said. Inspectors general need to be independent so they can handle sensitive investigations and cases, he said. …</p></blockquote>
<p>Too craven even for his fellow Republicans. Sad.</p>

“The American people are tough, resilient, and always full of hope. There’s not a single thing we can’t do if we do it together.”<br/>
Problem with that is Biden (and his cohorts) do their living and eating in Washington DC and the rest of us including those homeless have to do that living on the ground floors.<br/>

<p><em>What I don’t understand is if, with the proper depth of field to get the buds and the droplets both, the grid effect would still happen. Readers?</em></p>
<p>Yes, it would. The shape of the droplets causes them to act as lenses, which means the light reflecting from the grid (in this case the image is being created by the grid obstructing light, but the principle is the same) is being focused by, and projected from, the droplet. Therefore the sharpness of the image of the grid within the droplet will be proportional to the sharpness of the droplet itself. You can see some examples at the following link:</p>

<p>It seems to me that the camera has focused on the images of the background which are refracted in the droplets, rather than on the droplets themselves. To get both in focus you would have to reduce the aperture to increase the depth of field.</p>

<p>It might seem that way to you but it is incorrect. The image of the grate is formed by light rays being refracted at the surface of the droplet closest to the grate, resulting in a focused image being projected onto the surface of the droplet closest to the camera, much like a lens projects an image onto the surface of a piece of film or digital sensor. The shape of the droplet causes the image to be distorted, resulting in a fisheye effect. From there the light scatters and the rays that hit the camera lens are focused by the lens onto the surface of (in this case) the digital sensor. The macro pics at the supplied link show this more clearly (i.e. that the plane of focus is aligned with the water droplet), and it is worth remembering that DOF is very shallow at the subject distances from which macro photos are taken, even with a very small aperture (i.e. f/22). Some more images:</p>

<p>No, if the drop has a radius of 2mm the image of the background will be focused roughly 2mm closer to the camera than the front surface of the drop.</p>
<p>For the image to be at the surface the refractive index of the drop must be 2, water is 1.333.</p>

<section class="comment-content comment">
<p>Just thinking about this a little more:</p>
<p>– The image of the background that can be seen in the water droplet is the image of the background as projected onto the surface of the water droplet closest to the camera.</p>
<p>– As the focal length of the lens created by the droplet is longer than the radius of the droplet, the image of the background is not in perfect focus at the surface of the droplet.</p>
<p>– The image of the background in the droplet appears sharp as the magnification factor (i.e. image of background in the droplet is very small compared to the actual background) hides the fact that the image projected onto the droplet surface is not in perfect focus.</p>
<p>– Therefore, regardless of the surface of the droplet not coinciding with the focal point of the lens created by the droplet, the place to focus the camera for these types of pics is still the surface of the droplet closest to the camera.</p>
<p>I think…</p>
<p>Very interesting discussion btw.</p>

<p>I’m hoping Booker wins, but I’m less enthusiastic about what it portends. Much of his rise has come after some pretty centrist entities (KSR’s Matt Jones, Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Louisville and Lexington papers) pulled quick, long-knives-esque, endorsements once the Floyd protests (in KY also the Breonna Taylor protests) took off and held. Bottom line is that McGrath was easy to cut loose b/c she was not a native KY politician, and this has allowed a lot of entities who are big parts of the problem in the state to re-brand themselves, particularly to national commentators (and Lebron James) temporarily putting their eyes on the state because of McConnell.</p>

<blockquote><p>China’s elites fear their working class in a way that United States elites do not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the impression I have is that the Chinese government, down to the village level, is generally appointed from above. The 2000-year-old contract is that the government is an alien intervention that takes money. In return, it helps the peasants when there are floods or famines. The government’s ability to do this well is known as the “Mandate of Heaven”, that is, the emperor’s relationship with the unknowable forces that capriciously screw up life on the farm.</p>
<p>The Covid response in Wuhan showed this dynamic: the people expect the govt. to not screw up the pandemic response, and they’ll go along with major intrusion (for awhile).</p>
<p>This contract shows up in other ways: there are armed insurrections in mainland China every year. Nobody reports them, but there are peasants actively pitchforking around.</p>
<p>Also, the government is very federalized, to a degree westerners don’t quite get. There are periodic armed standoffs, and sometimes clashes, between security forces owned by different government departments.</p>

<p>The US coronavirus infection rate chart is chilling. November is too far off. Even Lindsey Graham is warning of another French revolution. A second lockdown without federal public health control and money for the affected is in rebellion territory.</p>
<p>Vaccine manufacturers are making millions of extra flu vaccine doses for next season; WaPo “CDC and drugmakers boost flu vaccine doses amid fears of an unprecedented respiratory illness season”. But if you haven’t caught COVID-19, who will take the risk of catching it to get a seasonal flu shot?</p>
<p>There is no future planning. Everything is ad hoc and disconnected. It is not just government that has fallen apart in the USA. It is the ultimate failure of the entire neo-capitalist ideology that markets control everything. Greed is the ultimate cause of the burgeoning deaths and the unrest in the West.</p>

<section class="comment-content comment">
<p>Firstly neoliberalism is just rewarmed Corporatism E.g. its a subset of Capitalism. Secondly I don’t think 19th century Eugenics in the U.S. died out, back of the bus post WWII, but reasserted itself with the advent of neoliberalism becoming dominate again in the 70s.</p>
<p>Just to touch on your health care[???] point I would highlight the dramas with aged care as a final extraction point not unlike a financial abattoir administrated by MBA’s and its executives are beholden to their share holders interests E.g. its an assembly line to the final departure point of palliative care.</p>
<p>Mates wife just started back to full time work after child bearing years [3 kids] and is working in aged care. She is a recent Mensa member and comes from a Japanese medical family, so shes not a pile of rocks. Anywho she is employed by an agency which flicks her around a bit [don’t want anyone in one place too long thingy] as basically a subbie. Now it gets even more interesting when one looks at how the system of work and credits is structured and how that plays out with charges and allocation of staff for it. Makes the episodes of Better Call Sal look salutary.</p>

<section class="comment-content comment">
<p>Greetings from the Murky North American South.<br/>
We experienced the elder human abattoir process from the other perspective when Phyl was involved with the Hospice company last year. The operative word in the foregoing sentence is “company.” The process was geared towards parsimony of an ‘exalted’ degree.<br/>
The most prominent example of that being the following. We had arguments with the ‘company’ about a particular wound dressing to be used on Phyl’s tumours. The company, (henceforth referred to as “they,”) wanted to palm off the lowest cost, and quality dressings, and manage the amount of said dressings to be used per week. Phyl found out about silver impregnated bandages and their superior performance for weeping wounds. (The tumours were of a Mad Doctor torture basement quality. They never healed and kept growing, hence, the later amputation. [We were told that the ‘removal’ was a last ditch effort. It seems to have done the trick so far.]) After a few weeks of the silver bandages, which were approved by Phyl’s first RN Visitor, ‘they’ switched Phyl back to the old bandages. When asked by this messenger of the Goddess why the switch, I was told that the old bandages were “best practice.” ‘They’ never wavered in their knavery. We ended up getting the silver impregnated bandages ourselves from off of mainly e-bay for the time up until the ‘leg removal.’ I regularly managed to find the silver bandages online for about half the price that ‘they’ were paying. The Wonder of Markets???<br/>
In one go round with ‘them’ about the bandage issue, I discovered, by accident, as I had managed to get hold of someone in the “back room” of the organization, that the office manager had priority over the nurses in the provision of supplies. The bean counters are firmly in control.<br/>
To return to the point, the original RN Visitor left the firm after she had been seeing Phyl, once a week no less, for two months. (Later on, we re-met her. She was now the head nurse for the local hospital’s Rehabilitation Annexe.) After that, there was an ever changing stream of LPNs arriving to do Phyl’s vitals and basic evaluation once a week. These were almost all young and entrance level workers in the healthcare field. They were mostly new and a bit naive about the situation they found themselves in.<br/>
There were two other ‘Visitors’ involved in ‘their’ scheme. One was a Social Worker, who was a nice woman, but obviously at her wits end in dealing with the situation. She seemed to be trying to “serve two masters.” ‘They’ wanted her to smooth the waters with Phyl, (I wonder why?) She wanted to shift some of ‘their’ attitudes, but was powerless to effect any change. The other was a ‘Pastor,’ to supply some moral support to the “customers.” This was a conservative fellow who had the good grace to be honest with himself and us about what was going on.<br/>
As to your point about “charges and allocation.”<br/>
First, I noticed right away that the Nurses, Social Worker and Pastor all drove their own cars for work purposes. Even with mileage, this is a losing proposition for the worker.<br/>
Second, the Nurses were tasked with covering a fairly large area. Several of the Nurses spoke of driving over a hundred and fifty miles in a day, on the job.<br/>
Third, we know, from the Medicare quarterly financials that the Hospice Company was getting over a thousand dollars a week per “customer.”<br/>
Fourth, this payment system was structured like a HMO. The price was a one size fits all payment. Some of the “customers” had to be ‘warehoused’ at the end. that was part of the basic rate.<br/>
Fifth, when Phyl decided to have the offending leg removed, she had to sign off of the Hospice program and re-enroll on the basic Medicare roll. The Hospice scheme was, therefore, aimed strictly at terminal patients, with no “wriggle” room. While good looking “on paper,” this guaranteed complications and delays in practice. (Everyone had reams of paper forms to be signed for any and all eventualities.)<br/>
Finally, taking care of family members at home is a real chore, and to this spoiled scion of the Hippy Jr. Age, an introduction to the concept of “vocation.” Not only has the experience shown me reserves of ‘character’ that I never suspected that I had, but it has also exposed many personal dark corners where plenty of ‘bad character’ lurk.<br/>
Kudos to you skippy for enduring your ordeal.<br/>
Congratulation to “Yves” for not shirking this hard job when it presented itself.<br/>
Everyone be vigilant and stay safe.<br/>
Rant ends.</p>

<p>For all the dramas its good news to hear her sticking around longer, if just to poke they* in the eye.</p>
<p>I can remember years ago when certain business sorts that had a puritan zeal were pushing the “best business” practice of breaking down human social attitudes at work, because it messed with MBA policy from above … all about malleability and setting up greasy pole competitions.</p>
<p>For me I have the kids and dogs and have been able to keep working so everything else is just a matter of time. Can’t force things so its just focusing on the things I can do.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>I would add that Yves keeping her mother out of one of these places is an act of high order. Just the relocation and time – energy spent to secure her mothers dignity at this stage in life is a sight to behold.</p>
<p>So many others I know with or without means seem to want to just shuffle off the olds so they “can get on with their lives” and not be burdened with the non productive – because markets ….</p>

<p>Just a report from the murky atmosphere of South Mississippi.<br/>
It literally looks like the Sahara Dust plume has reached our environs. This afternoon, the atmosphere was dusky and brown, or tan coloured in our half horse town. This is very unusual for here. Visibility was half of normal, and distinctly murky.<br/>
Some thunderstorms rumbled through the town this evening, but how well they cleaned the atmosphere up is something we’ll have to evaluate tomorrow morning.<br/>
How long this will last is anybody’s guess.</p>
