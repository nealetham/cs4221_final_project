<p>Banks are increasingly becoming tech companies, but meanwhile tech companies are also studying how to offer financial services. Apple, in addition to Apple Pay, now offers savings accounts to its U.S. customers in conjunction with Goldman Sachs. "The motivation is to offer consumers as many services as possible in their own ecosystem: embedded finance," argue Conny Dorrestijn (Shiraz Partners) and Ron Blaauboer (Yenlo) in the video collection Financials 2023.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Netbank sold Audi cars to its end customers in South Africa, and the bank sold even more than Audi itself. "It was then that banks had the most insight into large consumer purchases and could sell insurance in addition to cars at the same time," Dorrestijn explains. "Now those are the online players and you see that the power position of the banks is shifting."</p>
<p>That's why merchant bank Goldman Sachs is partnering with Apple. Where the division of roles is clear: Apple is the face to the outside world, and Goldman Sachs conducts the actual banking business, such as assessing risk.</p>
<p>Playing the consumer channel is a challenge in itself, Dorrestijn says. "It's about lower margins, higher volumes and customer friendliness."</p>
<p>Ron Blaauboer suspects that Apple just wants to make fat money out of it. In principle, they could still become a bank themselves. "They have so much cash that they could easily make loans."</p>
<p>The fact that they don't has everything to do with risk management. Dorrestijn: "I don't think big data players will just offer banking services. Still, I don't rule out the possibility that they might one day take over one of the many overpriced and overvalued neo-banks, innovative parties that are catching up with the 'big monkeys,' because traditional banks are by nature (too) cautious. Among those neo-banks are 'nice sweets' though.</p>
<p>On top of that, traditional banks carry around vastly outdated IT systems, and are not agile enough. "Take AI, with it you can assess behavior and risk much better.</p>
<p>What still often happens is that banks buy up innovative parties and "cuddle through" them. "The moment the marriage has taken place, they have to adapt. Almost never does such a party survive the culture," states Dorrestijn.</p>
<p>Car manufacturers today are largely component bakers, according to Dorrestijn; you see that trend returning in this financial world.</p>
<p>Which is not to say it will happen in the Netherlands, by the way. The strict regulations surrounding data and the availability of a functioning payment system create their own challenges. Still, according to Dorrestijn, Dutch banks will also have to ask themselves: "What do we want to be now? The bank is no longer center focus, let others do the selling, but then you have a well-run business. The bank needs to get rid of the idea that they can serve everyone."</p>
