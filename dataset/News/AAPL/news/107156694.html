<h1>Berkshire Hathaway stock price reaches $500,000</h1>

<p>Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 10% in 2022, outpacing the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, which has fallen 12%.</p>
<p>The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's market value is approximately $731 billion, ranking sixth in the United States, and Buffett's 16.2% stake makes him the world's fifth-richest person at $119.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine.</p>
<p>Berkshire generated a record $27.46 billion of operating profit last year, including gains at Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.</p>
<p>It also owns dozens of other businesses, including the fast-growing Clayton Homes mobile home unit and the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage.</p>
<p>Berkshire specializes in "on the ground, Main Street-esque business activity," said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix, which invests about $4.3 billion and owns Berkshire stock.</p>
<p>"They're big and they're not a tech stock, and investors get comfort from that."</p>
<p>Berkshire shares also slightly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in 2021, after lagging in 2019 and 2020. They closed up 0.8% on Monday at $493,785.</p>
<p>Most Berkshire operating units focus on the United States, and about 77% of its approximately 372,000 employees work there.</p>
<p>Among those expanding elsewhere is Dairy Queen, which plans by 2030 to add 600 stores in China, already its largest market outside the United States.</p>
<p>Berkshire traded below $20 when Buffett took over the then-struggling textile company in 1965. Its Class B shares are worth about 1/1500th of Class A shares.</p>
<p>U.S. companies with larger market capitalizations include Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Tesla Inc. Apple is also Berkshire's largest common stock holding.</p>
<p>Berkshire ended 2021 with $146.7 billion in cash, though it has since invested well over $5 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corp as oil prices soared.</p>
