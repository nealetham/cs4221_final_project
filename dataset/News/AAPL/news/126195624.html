<p>Feb 29 (Reuters) - Shares in AMS-Osram fell almost 40% and were set for their biggest ever daily drop on Thursday after a client, which analysts said could be Apple, cancelled a microLED technology project.</p>
<p>"The shock is still deep," the Austrian chipmaker's Chief Executive Aldo Kamper told a conference call, after a customer, whose identity AMS declined to disclose cancelled a key project for the pixel-sized LEDs which can be used in smartwatch displays.</p>
<p>Its Zurich-listed shares were trading 37% lower at 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>Kamper said AMS Osram will now have to reassess the future of a new factory for eight-inch silicon wafers, built specifically for this purpose in Kulim, Malaysia for 1.3 billion euros ($1.41 billion).</p>
<p>"We thought everything was on track," Chief Financial Officer Rainer Irle said, adding that the sale of the factory was under discussion.</p>
<p>JP Morgan said in a note that the cancellation, possibly related to Apple, would have a substantial impact on the company given the very significant research and development investment.</p>
<p>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>"The micro-LED project cancellation puts the future of the technology into question," Vontobel analyst Mark Diethelm said in a note, adding that the project was one of the key elements in the brokerage's investment thesis for the company.</p>
<p>The company said as a result of the cancellation, it expects impairment charges of 600 million-900 million euros and around 30 million-50 million euros lower adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for 2024.</p>
