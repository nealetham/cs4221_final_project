<h1>Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 fall with growth shares; banks boost Dow</h1>
<p style="color: #6a6a6a;">
<time>Published: 2022-01-04 15:12:34 ET</time>
<span class="ml-3 text-green font-weight-bold">AAPL</span>
</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite reversed Monday's strong gains to fall more than 1%, along with declines in shares of Tesla Inc, Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc.</p>
<p>Tesla fell 4.4%, a day after jumping more than 13% on stronger-than-expected quarterly deliveries while Apple, which became the first company to briefly hit $3 trillion in market capitalization on Monday, was down 1.1%.</p>
<p>The Dow hit a record intraday high and the S&amp;P financials index was on track for an all-time closing high, led by bank shares.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 bank index was up 3.7% and on track for its best day in about a year.</p>
<p>Some strategists said financials and other value-oriented stocks could lead markets in the near term as investors gear up for interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve by mid-year to curb high inflation. U.S. Treasury yields rose for a second trading day.</p>
<p>Investors are "going to punish growth stocks with high valuations," said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>"This is a time when defensive stocks and value stocks are likely to outperform."</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 value index climbed 1.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 growth index was down 1.4%.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 258.2 points, or 0.71%, to 36,843.26; the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.74 points, or 0.10%, at 4,791.82; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 256.34 points, or 1.62%, to 15,576.46.</p>
<p>The U.S. central bank said last month it would end its pandemic-era bond buying in 2022, signaling at least three rate hikes for the year. Minutes from the meeting are expected to be released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 also hit an intraday all-time high before falling, as the World Health Organization said more evidence was emerging that the coronavirus variant caused milder symptoms than previous variants.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co jumped 11.1% after the automaker said it would nearly double annual production capacity for its red-hot F-150 Lightning electric pickup to 150,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>Earlier, U.S. manufacturing data for December showed some cooling in demand for goods, but investors took solace in signs of supply constraints easing.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.54-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 70 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 98 new highs and 94 new lows.</p>
