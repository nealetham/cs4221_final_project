<p>* May CPI data unexpectedly flat</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Federal Reserve policy announcement due at 2 p.m. ET</p>

<p>June 12 (Reuters) -</p>
<p>U.S. stocks rose broadly on Wednesday, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq touching fresh record highs after softer inflation data lifted hopes for central bank rate cuts, while Apple overtook Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company.</p>
<p>As the focus shifts to the</p>
<p>Federal Reserve's policy announcement</p>
<p>, markets will zero in on Chair Jerome Powell's press conference and the Fed's updated "dot plot", which shows where policymakers expect interest rates to stand this year and long term.</p>
<p>Interest rates are overwhelmingly expected to remain unchanged at the meeting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple's shares climbed 4.4% to hit a record high, dethroning Microsoft for the first time in five months, as the iPhone maker's market valuation rose to $3.24 trillion versus Microsoft's $3.23 trillion.</p>
<p>The latest spurt came soon after Apple launched its artificial intelligence-integrated products on Monday, sprinting past AI chip powerhouse Nvidia's $3 trillion valuation.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Risk sentiment was boosted after a Labor Department report showed the</p>
<p>Consumer Price Index</p>
<p>was unchanged on a monthly basis in May, when it was expected to rise 0.1%. On an annual basis, inflation rose 3.3%, lower than economists' expectation of a 3.4% increase.</p>
<p>CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2%, compared with an expectation of a 0.3% rise, while core inflation rose 3.4% on an annual basis versus a forecast of 3.5%.</p>
<p>"This continues the process of inflation slowly coming down. The $64,000 question is, going forward, how quickly it will keep coming down," said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.</p>
<p>Markets boosted expectations for a September start to rate cuts after the data, pricing in an over 70% chance, according to the CME's FedWatch tool, from 54% prior to the report.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>"It still comes down to when the cuts start and how many times they (the Fed) will cut, and in our opinion, the market's probably being too exuberant," Samana said.</p>
<p>Rate-sensitive megacap stocks rose as Treasury yields fell, with the S&amp;P 500's information technology and an index tracking chip stocks at all-time highs.</p>
<p>Real-estate stocks rose to an over three-week high, while the small-cap Russell 2000 Index jumped</p>
<p>2.7</p>
<p>%.</p>
<p>At 12:04 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 106.95 points, or 0.28%, at 38,854.37, the S&amp;P 500 was up 59.77 points, or 1.11%, at 5,435.09, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 302.32 points, or 1.74%, at 17,645.87.</p>
<p>Among others, Oracle gained 11.7% after forecasting double-digit revenue in fiscal year 2025 after the bell on Tuesday.</p>
<p>U.S.-listed shares of electric-vehicle maker Nio slipped 0.8% after the European Commission announced extra tariffs on imported Chinese EVS.</p>
<p>Paramount Global fell 0.2% after Shari Redstone ended talks for a potential merger with David Ellison's Skydance Media.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.55-to-1 ratio on the NYSE, and by a 2.85-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P index recorded 38 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 90 new highs and 45 new lows.</p>
