However, Sherwood Senior Correspondent Ronnie Molla suggests this public show of support was more calculated than genuine. \"It's like they all prompted ChatGPT for the same response to publicly and then privately talk to Trump,\" Molla told Catalysts. She notes this was quite different from the tech leaders' reactions to Trump's 2016 win as CEOs now understand from his first presidency that he is capable of \"hold[ing] a grudge\" or being \"very vindictive.\" Molla singles out Tesla (TSLA) and Elon Musk's related companies, saying they \"stand to gain\" from Trump's return to the White House due to Musk's deep involvement in the former president's reelection efforts. However, for the broader tech sector, she cautions that the landscape remains \"so uncertain\" given Trump's potential policies around China tariffs and AI regulation.

Munson tells Yahoo Finance that Berkshire's growing cash pile reflects Warren Buffett's strategy to sell high, saying, \"I think you're going to have to see a market that trades much lower in valuation before you get him to do anything. And if he does anything that's not in a market that's getting crushed in its valuation, I think it's because he's going to look at things that he knows best or that are doing best and that's going to be in energy or in some of these industrial aerospace things that have been working well.\" Watch the video above for more on Munson's read of Berkshire's cash holdings and what's next for Warren Buffett.

So their comps are getting difficult\u2026 The earnings are moderating, but still are expected to settle in the 20s, which is extremely healthy.\u201d The results come as the companies have invested billions into building AI infrastructure without a clear timeline for monetization. Krishna says the \u201cbiggest uncertainty, or at least caution, I have is what do you pay for those earnings when they're moderating and when they've entered a phase in which a significant amount of uncertainty around the timing of monetization of AI spend?\u201d He notes \u201cThe historical experience in the last ten years when this Big Tech group has had a situation of high capital intensity in terms of spending and moderating earnings growth. Multiples have corrected reasonably strongly in those periods. That's the setup we have right now.\u201d Krishna says, \u201cWe are quite optimistic, but I think a lot rides on Big Tech to at least create that base of stability, even as they are moderating so much of those profits.\u201d He adds that companies like Alphabet \u201chave tremendous horsepower in terms of their capability and the ability to execute on AI. Don't forget, when you talk about Google, they were at the forefront of the whole AI phenomenon well over a decade ago.\u201d To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.

    "summary": "Tech stocks rallied after the Federal Reserve cut rates 50 basis points, with some of the Magnificent Seven names like Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) leading the charge. Citi head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss how to play the tech sector. \u201cIt's a buy the news, sell the news reaction to the Fed,\u201d Chronert says. \u201cThe leadership this quarter has really been those areas of the market that are perceived beneficiaries of lower rates. So real estate, utilities, even the homebuilder ETFs have been hitting recent highs. In the meantime, tech is still lagging where it was last time the index was through 5,600.\" \u201cEssentially what you have here\u2026 is that a bit of a profit taking on the news in those areas that have been perceived as rate sensitive. And, at the same time, a catch-up move in that mega-cap growth cohort that ultimately does benefit from lower interest rates, but has been a relative laggard thus far this quarter. All told, what you've got is an index moving higher.\u201d Taking a look at the Magnificent 7, Chronert outlines Citi\u2019s view on the group: \u201cWe've been arguing for the better part of this year that they're becoming more idiosyncratic in their behavior.\u201d He explains that Nvidia, Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 who control over 6% of the index \u2014 \"those companies are going to be important to index price action and I think you're seeing that today. But, what we're focused on from this barbell angle is we want to be holders of those, but when you look at the rate of increase in this and forward-year earnings expectations, it's been a stair-step function for over a year now. It's beginning to decelerate.\u201d For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts. This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.",

    "summary": "Semiconductor stocks rallied in Wednesday's trading session after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang highlighted \"great\" demand for AI chips. KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to discuss the state of the overall AI race and some of the key players in the sector. After Nvidia rose 8% intraday, Vinh believes the movement indicates \"a recovery based on kind of an overreaction on earnings.\" While Nvidia's most recent earnings met and beat expectations, investors were still disappointed as they looked for bigger returns. However, Vinh doesn't think the AI trade is stopping anytime soon: \"I think what really drove the recovery you're seeing more recently is that Oracle (ORCL) came out talked about very strong accelerating growth on the AI side. And they also said that their outlook for next year is going to result in a doubling of capex. So I think that's reassuring investors that the AI trade is not over yet.\" He argues that Oracle is \"one of the key important reads in terms of AI hyperscaler demand and spend going forward.\" He also points to AMD (AMD), Marvell (MRVL), and Broadcom (AVGO) as standout names in the \"expansive market\" and highlights Cirrus Logic (CRUS) as a lesser-known play. He calls the company a \"proxy for Apple (AAPL),\" noting that 80% of its revenue is Apple-driven. As the tech giant rolls out Apple Intelligence, Cirrus Logic will be a beneficiary, especially if it kicks off an upgrade cycle. While the AI race shows no signs of stopping, Vinh expects spending to be \"unabated\" as data centers become a crucial part of the equation. He explains, \"What we look at in our perspective, at least in the near to medium term, at least going into 2025, is that all these AI hyperscalers are going to have to aggressively spend. The next-generation platform that Nvidia is releasing, Blackwell, is going to basically lower your TCO (total cost of ownership) by 30x.\" \"So if we're still waiting for that monetization model, operationally, if you're a hyperscaler, you've got to go with the lowest cost TCO solution out there until you get that monetization model. So we don't see any sort of letup in spend over the next 12 months here,\" he concludes. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

    "summary": "Apple (AAPL) is gearing up for its highly anticipated product launch event on Monday, September 9th. To provide insights into what consumers can expect, CNET Senior Editor Lisa Eadicicco joins Asking for a Trend to discuss. Eadicicco notes that investors are primarily focused on the likely iPhone 16 product line-up, which is expected to be the \"star of the show.\" However, according to a Bloomberg report, Apple is also set to unveil three new Apple Watch models and updated AirPods. \"I think the big question on everybody's mind is gonna be how does Apple Intelligence play into all of this,\" Eadicicco states. She points out that some anticipated features include AI-powered text rewriting and email summarization, as well as an enhanced version of Siri tailored to individual users. Regarding Apple's AI integration, Eadicicco told Yahoo Finance, \"I think Apple's approach, based on what we've seen, is more contextual, it's more about kind of connecting the dots between the different apps on your phone and kind of using Siri as a way to do that.\" However, she cautions that these new AI features may not necessarily drive a widespread upgrade cycle among consumers.

The Futurum Group Chief Market Strategist Cory Johnson joins Market Domination to discuss whether this growth is sustainable. Johnson acknowledges there has never been a company as big as Nvidia that has managed to sustain such a high growth rate. He also notes how quickly Nvidia rose to the top of the market cap rankings. Due to the semiconductor powerhouse's enormous scale the market \"is noticing what's going on in this company,\" Johnson states. \"A reason to look at this company and understand [that] what's going on is so great is to look at the numbers. And look at the growth rate and look at the free cash flow generation, which is the ultimate... success of a business,\" Johnson told Yahoo Finance. He adds, \"And Nvidia is doing all of these things right now.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

    "summary": "Apple (AAPL) faces regulatory pressures after reports of several investigations, from an antitrust lawsuit brought on by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to the European Union's (EU) probe into Big Tech players. Evercore ISI Analyst Amit Daryanani \u2014 who has an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $220 per share \u2014 joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how Apple could potentially recover and get unstuck from the rock-and a-hard place the iPhone maker finds itself in the middle of. Daryanani notes that the EU probe poses \"more headline risk than fundamental risk,\" stating that he doesn't believe it has \"a material impact\" on Apple. However, he suggests that how \"elements in the US play out\" will have a more substantial financial impact on Apple, as investors await the fallout from the DOJ investigation and the broader implications of Apple's AI partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Regarding Apple's stock underperformance, Daryanani attributes it to the fact that the company is not being perceived as \"an AI story.\" He anticipates that at its upcoming WWDC 2024 conference, Apple will likely discuss the inclusion of Google's Gemini AI on iPhones and how AI can enhance the iPhone experience, which could serve as a good \"value [proposition]\" for the company's stock.

The import ban, issued by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), applies to Apple's current Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches and initially went into effect on Dec. 26.  Apple convinced the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to pause the ban the next day, and has since resumed selling the watches as it contests the import ruling.",

    "summary": "Apple (AAPL) manufactures and sells a range of technology products, including smartphones, personal computers, tablets, and headphones. I am bullish on the stock.\n\n\n\nIf you could only buy and hold one stock and then someday bequeath it to your grandchildren, AAPL would be as good a choice as any.\n\n\n\nIt's a legacy business with vast influence, to the point where people willingly cough up $1,200+ for a smartphone mainly based on Apple's reputation.\n\n\n\nApple's not a big dividend payer, as the forward annual yield is a meager 0.51%. However, Apple's trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 31.4 suggests that its stock isn't overpriced. (See Analysts\u2019 Top Stocks on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nIndeed, the stock is so attractive that one company has been hoarding millions of AAPL shares - and this should bolster any Apple investor's confidence.\n\n\n\nThe Poster Child for Buybacks\n\n\n\nGreat companies love to invest in themselves - literally. Apple is no exception to this rule, and one financial expert spotted a clear trend when it comes to stock-share repurchases.\n\n\n\nAccording to recent data from S&P Dow Jones Indices Senior Index Analyst Howard Silverblatt, around 53.8% of third-quarter stock buyback activity was fueled by the top 20 companies.\n\n\n\nCan you guess which company was at the top of Silverblatt's top-20 list of third-quarter buyback kings?\n\n\n\nOf course, it's none other than Apple. Reportedly, the company repurchased a staggering $20.45 billion worth of its own shares during the quarter.\n\n\n\n\"Apple continued to be the poster child for buybacks as it again spent the most of any issue, with the Q3 2021 expenditure ranked eighth highest in S&P history,\" Silverblatt commented.\n\n\n\nThis is significant, as it indicates Apple's confidence in itself as a successful business venture. In light of the company's major self-investment, anyone sitting on the fence should consider a long position in AAPL stock.\n\n\n\nStable Manufacturing\u00a0Data\n\n\n\nDon't get the wrong idea - investors shouldn't buy a stock just because the company's buying it.\n\n\n\nWith a gadget maker like Apple, manufacturing data is essential in assessing the company's future prospects. Fortunately, Apple's recently released numbers are absolutely outstanding.\n\n\n\nAccording to Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty, iPhone build rates in the December quarter \"remain stable,\" coming in at an 82 million-unit quarterly rate.\n\n\n\nThat throughput rate is quite impressive in a time when tech components are in short supply.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the Morgan Stanley analyst observed that the lead times for the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max models, as of December 21, were down to just two days, from 20 days one month prior to that.\n\n\n\nNot only that, but China posted iPhone shipment growth of 46% year-over-year for the quarter through November. Again, it's evidence that Apple won't be slowed down even amid global supply-chain issues.\n\n\n\nWall Street's Take\n\n\n\nTurning to Wall Street, Apple has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 21 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average Apple price target of $175.28 implies 0.6% downside potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Takeaway\n\n\n\nMost Wall Street analysts seem to be bullish on AAPL stock, and who could really blame them?\n\n\n\nApple's P/E ratio suggests that the shares aren't particularly expensive - and the company's stock buybacks indicate the company's supreme confidence in itself.\n\n\n\nSo, it's likely that the buy-side analysts are spot-on with their optimistic outlook on AAPL stock. If you're in the market for an asset to buy, hold, and forget about, Apple is a core investment you can probably count on.\n\n\n\nDisclosure: At the time of publication, David Moadel did not have a position in any of the securities mentioned in this article. \u200b\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\u00a0The information contained in this article represents the views and opinion of the writer only, and not the views or opinion of TipRanks or its affiliates \u00a0Read full disclaimer >",

    "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Big technology stocks surged on Wednesday as investors bet that likely Republican control of the Senate could create gridlock in Congress, limiting new legislation that may have weighed on the industry.Facebook Inc. jumped more than 8%, the biggest intraday gain since late August. Google parent Alphabet Inc. climbed over 6%, while Amazon.com Inc. rose 5.8% and Apple Inc. added 4%.Democratic prospects of taking control of the Senate faded on Wednesday after several vulnerable Republican incumbents fought off well-financed Democratic challengers. That helped ease concerns about big changes to U.S. antitrust laws targeting the largest internet platforms.\u201dWe now see a material reduction in the possibility of a meaningful overhaul to existing antitrust law,\u201d Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a research note on Wednesday. Facebook and Alphabet are \u201cmajor winners on this front,\u201d followed by Amazon, they said.Before Election Day, the tech industry was facing major regulatory threats. The Justice Department filed a landmark monopoly suit against Google and legislation was being prepared based on a recent House report alleging wide-ranging antitrust violations by Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.While the election results are still unknown, a \u201cBlue wave\u201d now looks unlikely, reducing the chances that the Senate will pass any major new laws attacking the tech industry.\u201dWithout massive change in the House and Senate, we won\u2019t see significant change,\u201d said Neil Campling, head of TMT research at Mirabaud Securities Ltd. \u201cThe status quo is good for tech.\u201d\u201cThe Market/Nasdaq is betting that whatever happens in the Presidential election the Senate will stay in the Republican majority,\u201d Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, wrote in an email. \u201cA Democrat-controlled Senate would be more likely to create overhauls and fines on Tech giants. Whereby, a Republican controlled Senate (which seems to be most likely) would have a more laissez-faire stance.\u201dRead more: Wave Bye-Bye to Blue Wave and Say Hello to GridlockMorgan also said that a Republican-controlled Senate would reduce the chance of an increase in capital gains taxes.\u201cA massive capital gains increase is not going to get through a Republican controlled Senate,\u201d he said. This has a \u201cbig positive impact\u201d on large tech stocks that have generated huge profits for shareholders in recent years, he added.Ahead of the election, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai wrote a memo to employees thanking them and urging them to stay focused. \u201cNo matter what tomorrow brings, Google\u2019s work continues,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cRecognizing the importance of good public policy, we will keep engaging with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in the U.S.\u201d(Updates with Google CEO memo in final paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "summary": "Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) has confirmed that it is adding Apple Inc's (NASDAQ: AAPL) streaming service, Apple TV, to the new Xboxes launching on Nov. 10.What Happened: \"We're excited to share that the Apple TV app is coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on [Nov. 10,]\" Microsoft said in a blog post.The news comes a week after Sony Corp (NYSE: SNE) announced adding Apple TV to its new PS5 console launching on Nov. 12.While Apple TV is coming on gaming consoles on the launch date, it will also be available on the older consoles like PS4 and Xbox One.Microsoft allows the users to subscribe to the Apple TV+ subscription from the Xbox at $4.99 per month (with a seven-day free trial) directly from the app. The Bill Gates-co-founded company said that other popular streaming services like The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE: DIS) Disney+ and Hulu, AT&T Inc.'s (NYSE: T) HBO Max, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ: GOOGL (NASDAQ: GOOG) YouTube and YouTube TV, Amazon.com Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video and Twitch, Comcast Corp.'s (NASDAQ: CMCSA  ) Peacock would also be available on the consoles.Other streaming platforms available on Xbox devices include those of Netflix Inc.'s (NASDAQ: NFLX), Spotify Technology SA (NYSE: SPOT), alongside Vudu, FandangoNow, Sky Go, NOW TV, and Sky Ticket.Why It Matters: The addition of Apple TV on gaming consoles puts the streaming app on all major platforms. According to Engadget, Apple has been aggressive in pushing its Apple TV service. The company offers one year of free subscription to buyers of the new Apple products like iPhone, iPads, or Macs.Apple TV+ low subscription price of $4.99 makes it difficult to ignore and puts them in competition with Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.As platforms allow direct subscriptions to Apple TV+ via the app, it could boost Apple's subscription revenue from the non-users of Apple products.Price Action: AAPL shares closed 0.08% lower to $108.77 on Monday, while MSFT shares dropped 0.06% to $202.33.Related Link: How Are PlayStation 5, Xbox Poised Before Launch?Photo courtesy of MicrosoftSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * How Are PlayStation 5, Xbox Poised Before Launch?  * 5 Biggest Tech Companies Took 18% More Revenue Last Quarter: WSJ(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

    "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Fiona Scott Morton is widely recognized as a top antitrust expert, known for her warnings that American tech giants are stifling competition and innovation.Yet Scott Morton, a Yale University economist and former Justice Department official, is also advising two of the biggest names in tech -- Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. -- as they confront federal antitrust investigations.She didn\u2019t disclose those relationships in papers she recently co-authored outlining how the U.S. could bring antitrust cases against Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc.Scott Morton, hailed in a 2019 article in the New Republic as an \u201cantitrust crusader,\u201d said she began consulting for Amazon in the last year, while her work for Apple dates back several years. She said she usually discloses her clients when speaking at conferences. The lack of disclosure on the Google and Facebook papers, she said, shouldn\u2019t be an issue because Apple and Amazon didn\u2019t pay her to write them. What\u2019s more, she added, those papers didn\u2019t focus on either Apple or Amazon.\u201cI work for companies that I\u2019m comfortable are not breaking the law,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cSo you\u2019re articulating what is making the market work well and how the company\u2019s conduct is pro-competitive or efficient.\u201dEthics experts and the American Economic Association for years have wrestled with real and perceived conflicts due to academic economists\u2019 consulting work. As antitrust probes intensify, the potential for conflicts could multiply as regulators and companies hire experts who can play a crucial role in shaping cases involving claims of anti-competitive behavior.Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are all grappling with federal investigations. A Justice Department lawsuit against Google is likely to come this summer. The heads of all four companies are set to testify July 27 before a House panel. Facebook and Google also face state probes.Scott Morton, who served in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division from May 2011 to December 2012, said that consulting is important to her research and teaching, and that she only takes on clients when she thinks a company isn\u2019t violating antitrust laws. She declined to give details about her work.Amazon confirmed Scott Morton is working for the company but declined further comment. Apple didn\u2019t respond to a request seeking comment.George DeMartino, a professor at the University of Denver who researches ethics in economics, said Scott Morton should have disclosed her work for Amazon and Apple in the papers. Economists are supposed to disclose real and potential conflicts that might influence their work, according to American Economic Association principles, he said.\u201cProfessionals have a duty to maintain trust, which as we now know is a fragile thing,\u201d said DeMartino, who\u2019s part of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies. \u201cThat requires disclosing any actual conflict of interest or any entanglement that might reasonably be interpreted by others as a conflict,\u201d said DeMartino, who emphasized that he isn\u2019t an antitrust specialist and added that he wasn\u2019t criticizing Scott Morton\u2019s integrity.Conflicts are rife in the antitrust field, said Gene Kimmelman, a senior adviser at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit that advocates for tougher antitrust enforcement, and a former chief counsel at the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust unit. His group worked with Scott Morton on the Google and Facebook reports, which were funded by a research grant from the Omidyar Network, a philanthropic organization co-founded by Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay Inc.A spokesperson for the Omidyar Network declined to comment on whether Scott Morton should have disclosed her consulting work.Kimmelman strongly defended Scott Morton, saying in an email that she disclosed her work for Amazon and Apple to him. \u201cI wish all antitrust economists and lawyers had the level of integrity and consistency in analysis she has demonstrated over and over again.\u201dKimmelman said he had to hire an outside lawyer to navigate potential conflicts among about 10 advisers that he asked to help produce the Facebook and Google studies, as well as others on Apple and Amazon. Most of them had some of kind of conflict, he said.\u201cPart of the game is to hire them to prevent your opponents from being able to hire them,\u201d Kimmelman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a large investment that can pay off enormously.\u201dEconomists are among the most important, and expensive, hires for companies facing antitrust inquiries by the government. Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley and who, like Scott Morton, had been a chief economist with the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, consults for Google. Shapiro said he discloses this whenever he speaks or writes.Google has been a prolific backer of economists, according to one study that identified 330 research papers published between 2005 and 2017 that Google supported directly or indirectly. Recipients didn\u2019t disclose the funding source in 65% of cases, the report said.Still, Scott Morton\u2019s decision to work for Amazon and Apple stands out because she has been a high-profile advocate for a more aggressive antitrust approach to tech companies, appearing on panel discussions, testifying before Congress, and speaking for quotation to news media, including Bloomberg News.Last year, Scott Morton, whose name appears on the roster of antitrust consultants at Boston-based Charles River Associates, co-authored a report by the University of Chicago on the immense power of tech platforms.One of the main criticisms against Amazon is that it operates an online marketplace used by third-party sellers while it also competes against those vendors, a situation sometimes described as a \u2018player-umpire\u2019 conflict. The company founded by Jeff Bezos argues that its platform is no different than brick-and-mortar supermarkets offering products with in-house labels alongside brand-name merchandise.Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, argues that Amazon crushes small companies by copying products sold on its marketplace and selling them under its AmazonBasics line.\u201cGiant tech companies have too much power,\u201d Warren tweeted in April 2019. \u201cMy plan to BreakUpBigTech prevents corporations like Amazon from knocking out the rest of the competition. You can be an umpire, or you can be a player -- but you can\u2019t be both.\u201dScott Morton retweeted the video clip and said, \u201cThis is the most articulate explanation of this Amazon theory of harm I have heard so far.\u201d She has since deleted that tweet. She said she regularly deletes old tweets.\u201cHer description of what made her upset about Amazon was so good that you just understood it and she did it in 15 seconds or something like that,\u201d Scott Morton said about Warren. \u201cI was just in awe of her ability to communicate.\u201dAt a Center for Economic Policy Research discussion last month, Scott Morton said companies that act as both umpire and player become a problem \u201cwhen the owner of the platform says, \u2018I don\u2019t want more competition and substitutes. I\u2019m just going to cut this party off.\u2019\u201dAbout an hour into the discussion, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of work for Apple and I\u2019m currently working for Amazon.\u201dThe Google and Facebook papers that Scott Morton wrote argue for antitrust action against both, but are silent on potential antitrust harms posed by Apple and Amazon.The Google paper argues that Google\u2019s power is unique. Advertisers can choose to buy space on Facebook or Amazon, or to go through Google to reach other publishers. But newspapers and other publishers have little choice but to go through Google\u2019s advertising technology. It\u2019s been able to use that power to harm advertisers and publishers, according to the paper.\u201cMy job is not to take down technology companies,\u201d she said in the interview. \u201cMy job is to understand markets and try to figure out when they\u2019re working and when they\u2019re not.\u201d(Updates with deleted Warren tweet from 22nd paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

Available for pre-order on Kickstarter , the iBoy, created by designer Philip Lee, is a cross between a robot and an iPod with a functional rotating click wheel, a mirror-like chrome finish on the back, antenna formed from EarPods, and magnetic arms. There are no electronic parts inside as the iBoy is meant to be a figurine for display, but it does look like a functional MP3 player. With the magnetic limbs and EarPods pulled off, it can convert from robot mode to an MP3 player mode that more closely resembles the iPod. While the rear of the iBoy has the chrome finish at the back, the body is made from an iPod-like glossy white ABS plastic, silk-screened details complete with ports, clickable buttons, and the aforementioned click wheel that actually turns. Though we often shy away from sharing Kickstarter projects because of issues with production and oft-delayed release dates, Classicbot's Philip Lee has an established storefront and experience making many other similar toys.",

Following yesterday\u2019s swift ride up the elevator, markets had a much weaker tone this morning as the market keeps gyrating. The pattern continues being one day up and one day down, and it\u2019s unclear how long we\u2019ll keep seeing these wild day-to-day percentage changes. That\u2019s because it\u2019s unclear how long the virus situation might last and what impact it might have on economies and companies. At this point, it isn\u2019t even the virus itself that\u2019s necessarily hurting the market. It\u2019s the ancillary reaction to the virus and the downhill impact of that. This will have a huge impact on businesses and cities. When you hear about the possibility of the NCAA tournament being played in empty stadiums, for instance, you realize the financial impact this can have. People worry about consumer spending, but when you cancel so many events, people just can\u2019t spend.",

After three iPhone generations with the same design, the iPhone 12 series will replace the current housing with one that has flat metal edges on the sides instead of round ones. That said, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the camera cluster on the back will still look the same and there will still be a big notch on the front, so it doesn't exactly seem like it'll end up being all that different from the iPhones we already have. Where Android smartphones are concerned, things get a little more complicated. There are a few foldable smartphones that have launched recently, and those designs are new and different. That said, they're not exactly going to win any beauty pageants.

    "summary": "While it remains to be seen if the coronavirus ultimately has much of an impact on when Apple's iPhone 12 hits store shelves, the epidemic is already impacting iPhone replacement availability. According to a new report from Bloomberg , Apple has started informing retail stores that \"replacement iPhones for heavily damaged devices will be in short supply for as long as two to four weeks.\" On a related note, some stores employees have already started noticing that certain replacement parts -- such as displays and camera modules -- are in short supply as well. Tim Cook, meanwhile, recently said at an Apple shareholder meeting that the coronavirus is a \"fairly dynamic situation\" and that it may prove to be a challenge for the company. That said, Cook a few days ago made a point of noting that Apple recently re-opened most of its stores in China and that a good number of stores may return to normal working hours soon. Of course, Apple's biggest challenge in the wake of the coronavirus centers on its manufacturing partners, many of whom are not operating anywhere close to full capacity.",

    "summary": "While companies like Samsung and Apple are still battling for smartphone dominance when it comes to premium handsets, a growing market for more affordable devices has emerged. This, of course, shouldn't come as much of a surprise given how pricey flagship smartphones cost these days. Especially with carrier subsidies now nothing more than a distant memory, folks interested in picking up a next-gen smartphone often have to shell out well over $1,000 for a new device. Naturally, not everyone is keen on breaking the bank on a new device, especially given that smartphones these days tend to last longer than in years past. All the same, pricey new smartphone models have created room for budget-oriented devices with impressive hardware to flourish. Indeed, that's the very reason why the original iPhone SE was so popular and why a lot of people are excited for Apple to finally release the iPhone 9, a device set to be something of an iPhone SE successor. Apple, though, is far from the only company looking to push out an affordable yet fully capable smartphone.",

A few other retailers are nearly matching that price this week as well, including Best Buy and Adorama . Although the AirPods Pro are in stock on Amazon this week, they have not been discounted to their previous sale price of $235.

    "summary": "iPhone 12 models will feature a \"refreshed\" front-facing TrueDepth system that benefits Apple supplier Lite-On Semiconductor, according to Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis, Thomas O'Malley, and Baylie Harri. This suggests that Face ID could be improved on iPhone 12 models, but no specific details were provided. In a research note provided to MacRumors, the analysts added that the rear-facing camera system on iPhone 12 Pro models will feature 3D sensing based on a time-of-flight solution, as widely rumored . They also expect iPhone 12 Pro models to be equipped with 6GB of RAM , up from 4GB in iPhone 11 Pro models. The biggest change of all could come next year, as the analysts said they see potential for Apple to remove the Lightning connector from at least one iPhone model in 2021, echoing a prediction shared by fellow analyst Ming-Chi Kuo last month. This could result in wired EarPods being removed from the box, they said. Kuo has said that Apple plans to release five new iPhone models in 2020 , including a lower-end \"iPhone SE 2\" or \"iPhone 9\" by the end of March and four higher-end, 5G-enabled models in the fall.",

    "summary": "Apple on Monday released Xcode 11.3.1 with bug fixes and improvements, including reducing the size of dependency files produced by the Swift compiler, which can improve incremental build times and disk usage for targets with many source files. Full release notes are posted on Apple's developer website . As with Xcode 11.3, version 11.3.1 supports developing apps for iOS 13.3, iPadOS 13.3, macOS 10.15.2, watchOS 6.1, and tvOS 13.3. It has been nearly one month since Apple seeded new betas for its software platforms, which is an unusually long time. The first betas of iOS 13.3.1, iPadOS 13.3.1, macOS 10.15.3, watchOS 6.1.2, and tvOS 13.3.1 were seeded on December 17, but no further builds have been made available since then. Apple always stops seeding betas over the holidays, but the cycle usually resumes in early January, including January 7 in 2019, January 3 in 2018, and January 9 in 2017, so there is a bit of a delay this year. On an Xcode-related note, Apple has reminded developers that, starting April 2020, apps submitted to the App Store must use an Xcode storyboard to provide the app's launch screen and must have an interface that supports any display size.",
