The decision comes as Big Tech companies have turned to nuclear energy to power their artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, stoking some worries about the recent rally in nuclear energy stocks. ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. \"Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers. But the order may not represent a long-term risk. It's more that FERC may have punted or didn't want to set a precedent about co-location.\" Fox outlines, \"Regulators are concerned about three things. They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy. Does the influx of new data centers create a concern about being able to meet state or local decarbonization policies?\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here.

    "summary": "Energy and power grid constraints look to be the biggest hurdles for Big Tech to overcome in the industry's wider buildout of AI data center infrastructure. Tech players have begun investing in nuclear energy developers to find the clean energy output needed to power these expansions. Oklo Inc. (OKLO) is one of these names benefitting from the trend, its stock having jumped nearly 200% over the past month. The nuclear startup is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who is also Oklo's chairman. Oklo Co-Founder and CEO Jake DeWitte joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to talk about the long-term investments in small modular reactors (SMR) and the intricacies of these systems; Oklo doesn't expect to finish building its first SMR and producing power from it until 2027. \"When you split an atom, you get almost 50 million-times more energy than when you combust like a molecule of natural gas or so. It's incredible,\" DeWitte tells Yahoo Finance. \"What that means, then, is there's a lot of energy in nuclear fuel. And actually in almost all reactors, you only use about 5% of the fuel in one pass through the reactor. And there's reasons why long story short, is you could put more fuel in, it could run for longer. But that comes at increased cost for the added systems you would need to manage all that.\" US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm told Yahoo Finance that her department's focus will be on ensuring these AI data centers are powered by clean energy, while understanding the challenge in widespread SMR adoption: \"Nobody wants to be the one to buy the first one.\" Oklo has already inked energy partnerships with date center providersw Equinix (EQIX) and Wyoming Hyperscale. DeWitte describes the regular business model for nuclear systems as \"clunky.\" \"One of the things that we set out to do in the beginning was, was make it easier to buy what people really want from nuclear systems, in other words, make it easier to buy nuclear power because the clean, reliable, affordable power, that's the stuff people really want,\" DeWitte explains. \"We're unique because we actually make that easy \u2014 we design, we own, we operate the plants, we contract someone to build them, and then we just sell the power out to the customers through off-take agreements. That makes it easy for them to buy what they want.\" For more coverage on Big Tech's adoption of nuclear energy, catch Yahoo Finance's respective interviews with X-energy CEO Clay Sell about Amazon's (AMZN) investment into the nuclear reactor designer and Kairos Power Co-Founder and CEO Mike Laufer's input on the nuclear startup's partnership with Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL).

    "summary": "Consumers are shopping early for the holiday season, turning to retailers offering discounts, a recent CNET survey shows. Dashia Milden, CNET money editor, joins Wealth! host Brad Smith to discuss what the survey indicates about consumer behavior for the upcoming holiday season. \u201cThe majority of shoppers right now are planning on leaning on those early holiday sales. When we start thinking about [Amazon\u2019s (AMZN)] Prime Day sales literally launching tomorrow. Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), you name it,\u201d Milden tells Yahoo Finance. On top of looking for deals, shoppers are also cutting down their holiday spending. \u201cThe majority of shoppers are shopping early to try to take advantage of some of those savings, and they're still making sacrifices. A percentage are spending less on non-essentials, such as travel and dining. People are setting smaller budgets, even and even choosing to go ahead and get fewer gifts. So when we start looking at that, it's very clear that the holidays are important and that they're willing to make some sacrifices in the meantime.\u201d As far as savings tips, Milden says, \u201cIt really depends on what you're looking for,\u201d but CNET\u2019s shopping experts recommend \u201cmaking sure that you are looking at the deals and comparing prices.\u201d She adds that for October, shoppers may want to take advantage of deals on batteries ahead of the holidays. Some shoppers may find themselves tempted to buy products they see when scrolling social media, but Milden notes that these might not always be the best option. \u201cIt can be a really good deal depending on what you look for, but it could also be a slippery slope. So I just want to advise while it could be good to find that deal or find that really nice gadget, it can lead to a little bit of overspending and even debt. So just being mindful there.\u201d For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth! This post was written by Naomi Buchanan.",

AWS CEO Matt Garman says the partnership was driven by the desire to offer something unique and valuable to customers.\u00a0 One big focus for AWS has been AI. Garman tells Yahoo Finance that, \"When the generative AI wave happened, we took a step back and said, 'How do customers really wanna get value out of that?' They want to really secure infrastructure. They have to worry about low cost. They want all of the best capabilities that are possible. And so then we went about and built an enterprise platform for customers to really drive AI into their applications. And what that means is it's not just one model. It's not just one feature. It's not just one particular application. It's a platform where you can use all of those capabilities.\" He says that by utilizing a platform approach, customers can use a specific large-language model or several large-language models in a way that works best for them. On the perception that AWS may be perceived as lagging Microsoft (MSFT) in the AI race, Garman says, \"At Amazon we have a saying that we're willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time. And for us, we felt that it was more important to actually build a baseline platform that customers could really go build real enterprise value into their applications on, as opposed to rushing in and quickly getting out chatbot technology... But that's not really the eventual place that the value is gonna come from this technology. It's not just chatbots.\" Watch the video above to hear Garman explain why there's \"a ton of potential\" for AWS chips. This post was written by Stephanie Mikulich.",

    "summary": "A new wave of humanoid robots is threatening to shake up the labor market. Built like humans and fueled by artificial intelligence, the machines are learning to tackle complicated tasks at a rapid rate. The advancement of generative AI is supercharging how quickly humanoids can learn, backed by vast amounts of data and high-powered chips. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has doubled down on its future, building out an ecosystem that enables robotics makers to customize their products. The Isaac robotics platform, which includes generative AI foundation models and tools, allow developers to simulate real- world movements in the digital world, while Nvidia\u2019s Thor system-on-a-chip (SOC) provides the computing power needed to drive the transformation. Already, Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN) and others are incorporating humanoids in their work spaces. At a recent shareholder meeting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the machines had the potential to propel the EV maker into a $25 trillion market cap company. Tesla is looking to capture the market by integrating its Optimus humanoid into factory floors. Musk has said two robots have already been deployed at the company\u2019s Fremont, California factory and predicted \u201ca few thousand\u201d Optimus robots to be working by 2025. But the company faces plenty of competition. Austin-based Apptronik has already signed partnerships with logistics firm GXO and Mercedes-Benz to deploy its humanoids to their floors, while Amazon has begun using Agility\u2019s Digit robot in its test facility. Watch to see what\u2019s NEXT in humanoid robots. If you\u2019re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what\u2019s NEXT.

Big Tech companies like Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) have all announced major investments in building out their AI infrastructures. While the plans show confidence in the future, will they actually pay off? Bokeh Capital Partners Founder and Chief Investment Officer Kimberly Forrest joins Morning Brief\u00a0to give insight into the AI sector and discuss which companies are in the best position to actually benefit from AI investments. When asked about when investors will see real payoffs from these big investments from AI, Forrest says: \"Building out the data center is part of it, then you're going to have companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon (AMZN), and everybody else is going to pile in and start using the generative AI to maybe increase productivity... And I would look for who do you think is most likely to benefit from using generative AI. And we've just mentioned them, right? Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, and to me Microsoft is really probably [in] the best position because they'll get people to actually pay for it, not just advertising dollars.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

She believes \"there's going to be some difficulty, I think, in hitting some numbers that continue to make the stocks move higher,\" given lofty expectations. Fernandez explains that stocks like the tech giants have already priced in anticipated gains from areas like AI monetization. This helps explain disappointing results from names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) recently. Of the tech titans, she sees Apple (AAPL) as most worrisome for investors, since it has been \"down versus the rest of that Magnificent Seven for a while,\" and faces a \"tricky\" path to meet forecasts. Given high valuations, Fernandez notes she has been \"trimming\" tech holdings, advising investors not to \"go all in\" on those stocks. However, she singles out Microsoft as a top tech pick thanks to strengths in AI, cash flow, and balance sheet. Watch the video above to hear what Fernandez has to say about investing in Amazon.

Continuously outperforming expectations in spite of higher interest rates, can these stocks keep their shine with the Federal Reserve signaling an end to rate hikes? Envestnet Co-Chief Investment Officer Dana D'Auria joins Yahoo Finance to discuss stock market forecasts for 2024 and provides alternatives to the Magnificent Seven for investors to put in their portfolios.

As part of the event, the companies agreed to voluntary safeguards to better manage the risks posed by AI. Meta's President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg attended the meeting. After its conclusion, Clegg joined Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith and Allie Garfinkle to shed light on what was discussed. One of the big concerns about AI is how it could be used to spread misinformation or disinformation in a way that could impact an election. Clegg says that Meta's systems, including the ones related to AI, will \"tackle\" malicious or nefarious content \"regardless of where its created, whether it's created by a human being or by a machine.\" Clegg adds that Meta has spent $16 billion over the last few years on defensive and protective systems and that \"tens of thousands of people working on this around the clock.\" When asked about the 2024 U.S. elections, Clegg points out that Meta has a large user base around the world and, as a result, is constantly having to prepare for elections, saying that \"with each election we learn more, because it's a very adversarial space.\" \"I do think we are getting better. We have constant practice in doing this,\" Clegg adds. Click here to see the full interview with Nick Clegg.

    "summary": "Next week will see Amazon (AMZN) step up to the earnings plate. The company will deliver 4Q21\u2019s financials on February 3 (Thursday, AMC) and investors will be hoping the performance will enable the stock to perform a turnaround. So far, shares have retreated by 15% in January\u2019s market wide carnage.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t get your hopes too high, though, appears to be the message from Wedbush\u2019s Michael Pachter. The analyst expects \u201cgloomy year-end results driven by macroeconomic factors.\u201d He attributes his bearish outlook to the \"ongoing supply chain crisis and full U.S. employment,\" which \"likely limited Amazon\u2019s fulfillment capabilities during the holiday quarter.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeveral years of costly investments, to assert more control over the shipping trajectory of its products, have helped Amazon mitigate some supply chain issues. Yet, Pachter notes that according to SJ Consulting Group, around 30% of its own packages are still reliant on delivery partners. \u201cThis means that industry-wide shortages in shipping containers, truck drivers, and readily available ports likely impacted delivery times and caused strain for many orders as shipping containers surged from under $2,000 before the pandemic to over $20,000 with multi-week delays,\u201d Pachter explained. \u00a0\n\n\n\nMoreover, due to customers hoping to avoid future delays, supply chain issues were probably further exacerbated by \u201celevated\u201d shopping levels for products already in high demand, such as semiconductors.\n\n\n\nOn top of these headwinds, Pachter thinks that during the quarter, Amazon was also likely negatively impacted by the U.S. labor market, which fell to a 3.9% unemployment rate in December. Accordingly, Pachter thinks Amazon was probably hit by \u201caccelerating wage growth as well as a higher mix of shorter-term workers amid a lax job environment.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt all implies Amazon will likely put a lid on expectations for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe combination of a national unemployment rate that is expected to continue dwindling until year-end and an ongoing supply chain fiasco leads us to believe that management will be conservative when guiding investors on a top-line and profitability basis,\u201d the analyst added. \n\n\n\nNot everything is doom and gloom, however. Pachter believes that Amazon is well-placed for strong growth\u00a0over the long term, noting: \"We see significant long-term growth opportunity as management continues to build out its cloud arm and marketplace capabilities to more consumers, and advertisers, worldwide.\"\n\n\n\nAll in all, Pachter rates AMZN shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with a $3,950 price target. This figure suggests shares will climb 40% over the next 12 months. (To watch Pachter\u2019s track record, click here)\n\n\n\nOngoing headwinds or not, there are currently 30 AMZN reviews from Wall Street analysts and all are positive, making for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The outlook calls for one-year gains of ~47%, considering the average target currently stands at $4,135 and change.

    "summary": "Shares of e-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN) followed in the footsteps of the S&P 500 lower amid fears of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. Omicron, labeled as a variant of concern, threatens to slow the world economy's recovery. Despite this, the Federal Reserve is still set to raise rates in 2022.\n\n\n\nIndeed, stocks have been quite volatile. With various European nations at the cusp of locking down, investors must face the reality that the COVID-19 pandemic is not yet over. As we learn more about the Omicron variant, investors may fear that things could get ugly again, as they were in 2020.\n\n\n\nHowever, I remain incredibly bullish on Amazon stock and think the Omicron-driven pullback is unwarranted. (See Analysts\u2019 Top Stocks on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nOmicron Variant Risks Ahead\n\n\n\nOmicron variant risks are real, but investors need not panic. While the variant may be a cause for concern, there are vaccines, test kits, and enhanced safety protocols like vaccine passports to help minimize the impact of localized outbreaks. \n\n\n\nWhether or not Omicron sends full lockdowns sweeping through the U.S. remains to be seen. Regardless, investors should look to Amazon stock as one of the names that should rally or at the very least hold its own amid renewed COVID-19 fears.\n\n\n\nAmazon got a major boost in 2020 when physical stores locked down, and consumers turned to digital retailers. Should Omicron pause or even reverse the economic reopening, Amazon is bound to see at least a partial return of the pandemic tailwinds that mostly faded this year.\n\n\n\nMoreover, with a low bar set on consumer spending for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the coming holiday season, Amazon could have the means to really impress once it finally pulls the curtain on its final quarter of 2021. \n\n\n\nAmazon May Be a Hedge against Further Lockdowns\n\n\n\nWith or without Omicron-induced lockdowns, Amazon looks positioned to sustain a breakout to much higher levels. Even if consumer spending grinds to a slowdown, more heightened COVID fears are likely to see Amazon take some share away from firms operating primarily in the physical realm. \n\n\n\nAny such variant-induced sales boosts could help the company move past recent inflationary woes that weighed heavily on margins in its most recent quarter.\n\n\n\nUndoubtedly, Amazon strives to keep costs low, even as wage and shipping prices rise. The Great Resignation has also made it tough to retain and attract talent. While the recent trajectory of operating margins may be discouraging, such margin pressures are likely to be transitory in nature.\n\n\n\nIn spite of pressures applied by a less favorable macro environment, Amazon's third-quarter results remained close to the middle of the original guidance. Still, Q3 earnings did fall well short of consensus estimates (EPS of $6.12 versus the $8.92 consensus), derailing Amazon stock's breakout hopes.\n\n\n\nIn due time, inflation is bound to cool off. With a potential COVID lockdown-induced sales boost thrown into the equation, Amazon has the means to sustain a rally after over a year of consolidating in the low-to-mid $3,000 range.\n\n\n\nWall Street's Take\n\n\n\nTurning to Wall Street, Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 31 Buys assigned in the past three months. the\u00a0average Amazon price target of $4,116.94 implies 19.8% upside potential.\n\n\n\nAnalyst price targets range from a low of $3,800.00 per share to a high of $4,700.00 per share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line on Amazon Stock\n\n\n\nThrough most of 2021, Amazon swam against the tide. Going into the new year, the tides may very well turn in its direction again, which could bode incredibly well for a stock that I believe is one of the cheapest of the FAANG cohort.\n\n\n\nAll 31 analysts covering the e-commerce giant have Buy ratings on the stock, and for good reason.\n\n\n\nDisclosure: Joey Frenette owned shares of Amazon at the time of publication.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained in this article represents the views and opinion of the writer only, and not the views or opinion of TipRanks or its affiliates\u00a0 Read full disclaimer >",

    "summary": "Amazon (AMZN) is a company that requires no introduction. A behemoth in the e-commerce and cloud computing industry, Amazon also offers digital streaming and AI solutions. However, Amazon\u2019s performance of late is indeed raising some eyebrows. \n\n\n\nI remain bullish on Amazon stock, and see this company as a winner in the long-term race for e-commerce supremacy. Let's dive into what's been driving the price action with this behemoth of late. (See\u00a0Analysts\u2019 Top Stocks on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nLacklustre Q3\n\n\n\nAmazon's stock chart over the long-term is impressive. However, this company certainly hasn't proved to be volatility-free over the years.\n\n\n\nAmazon's valuation has remained higher than most of its large-cap peers for some time. The company's growth trajectory has allowed for this valuation gap. \n\n\n\nEarnings reports tend to provide volatility for most stocks. However, companies like Amazon can see more volatility during earnings season than other stocks. Such was the case this past quarter.\n\n\n\nLate last month, Amazon reported earnings that didn't give investors the jolt they hoped for. To be fair, AMZN stock rallied into earnings. Accordingly, a significant amount of exuberance was priced into this report.\n\n\n\nNet earnings came in at $6.2 billion for the quarter, which was actually a drop from last year's $6.3 billion tally. Given that 2020 was a pandemic year, that's a pretty high baseline to go off of. However, any sort of drop in profitability is likely to be viewed negatively, particularly for a company of Amazon's ilk.\n\n\n\nThese results also suggested to investors that fears that the economic reopening may hinder earnings are real. How many quarters this weakness persists remains to be seen. It should be noted that the company did report revenue growth of 15%. However, this growth rate was down from the 16% rate reported last year.\n\n\n\nShortages in labor supply, tightness in the global supply chain, and rising costs across the board could impact margins over the near term. The market appears to be pricing in this risk. \n\n\n\nHowever, long-term investors quickly snapped up AMZN shares over the past month, bringing this stock to within 10% of its all-time high. Amazon isn't a stock that's likely to remain depressed for long. At least, that's what the market appears to be telling us.\n\n\n\nAWS Shines\n\n\n\nOne of the key bright spots in an earnings report that most have called lackluster, was Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS accounts for the e-commerce behemoth's fast-growing Cloud segment. \n\n\n\nThis segment brought in Q3 revenues of more than $16 billion. That was good for a 39% year-over-year increase, and a 29% quarter-over-quarter rise. \n\n\n\nOperating margins in this segment came in at around 30%. For Amazon, that's high. Investors looking for a profit driver in the quarters to come are increasingly looking at AWS to make up the difference from margin contraction resulting from supply chain issues.\n\n\n\nAWS is Amazon's golden child right now. This is the segment true long-term investors will want to keep an eye on, as Amazon navigates its way through a difficult competitive environment.\n\n\n\nRetention Policies, Staff Recruiting\n\n\n\nWith multiple headwinds, as discussed earlier, Amazon\u2019s tactical move to combat these forces is indeed laudable. The company is making heavy investments in its staff recruiting, through\u00a0expensive retention policies like free college tuition fees, increased salaries, etc., for its employees.\n\n\n\nThese moves have affected Amazon\u2019s Q3 earnings. Some investors may not like any company paying its workers more. However, there's a strong argument to be made that Amazon is investing in its human infrastructure to be able to continuously grow. \n\n\n\nAccording to a number of experts on this matter, these steps will be essential to maintain a positive customer experience and manage shopper expectations. Arguably, these strategic investments will ultimately help Amazon grow its manpower along with its morale.\n\n\n\nNew VTR Policy\n\n\n\nRecently, Amazon sent a notice to third-party merchants that they need to\u00a0maintain a VTR (valid tracking rate) for at least 95% of their products.\u00a0Inability to do can result in getting delisted from the platform. On the company's webpage, it was reported this was only applicable to merchants in China. However, several businesses in Canada were affected as well.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis mass suspension wiped out a significant proportion of AMZN\u2019s sales. Further, many customers also refused to buy from merchants as the shipping charges were higher.\n\n\n\nThese negative catalysts appear to be priced in, and Amazon is working on ways of resolving this issue. Over the longer term, it's more likely that Amazon will find a way to lead the way in product tracking, while also investing in its suppliers to make this happen. However, the headlines certainly haven't been good for Amazon lately.\n\n\n\nWhat's Next?\n\n\n\nAmazon is lining up to open its department stores, indicating its expansion into the brick-and-mortar category. The stores will come with a\u00a0high-tech dressing rooms, assisted with touchscreens. Customers will have access to over 100 private-label offerings at the touch of their fingerprints.\n\n\n\nThe e-commerce giant is also expanding its grocery service business, growing the number of its locations rapidly to bolster both online and offline sales. This will also help Amazon to mitigate supply chain issues \u2013 a major factor in increasing prices.\n\n\n\nIn the next 12 months, Amazon is looking to rake in around $150 million in Economic Operating Cash Flow (EBITDAR). The company the hopes to boost its investments in technology and infrastructure, along with making strategic acquisitions and expanding its retail stores in the coming years.\n\n\n\nWall Street's Take\n\n\n\nAs per TipRanks' analyst rating consensus, AMZN stock is a Strong Buy. Out of 31 analyst ratings, there are 31 Buy recommendations.\n\n\n\nThe stock has a median price target of $4,095. Amazon's price targets range from a high of $4,500 to a low of $3,800 per share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nAmazon\u2019s Q4 guidance does not seemingly provide much in the way for investors to be bullish on this stock. However, taking the longer-term view of Amazon, it's hard to argue against this company's growth prospects.\n\n\n\nAs we head into what could be a blockbuster holiday shopping season, all eyes will be on how this e-commerce juggernaut performs this quarter.\n\n\n\nDisclosure: At the time of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have a position in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\u00a0The information contained in this article represents the views and opinion of the writer only, and not the views or opinion of TipRanks or its affiliates \u00a0Read full disclaimer >",

    "summary": "Amazon's (AMZN) heavy investment in people to capitalize on rising consumer demand is a big lesson for other retailers, according to Craig Elston, Head of Strategic Services at Iterable. \"Amazon's decision making is a lesson for other retailers: deliver a positive customer experience in the face of seasonal headwinds, and you can capitalize on an increase in consumer demand,\" he says.\n\n\n\nAmazon's businesses have been under pressure lately, as evidenced by a lackluster Q3 financial report last week. The online giant's top and bottom lines missed analyst estimates and gave lackluster guidance for Q4. \n\n\n\n\"It should come as no surprise that Amazon's earnings are at the mercy of economic pressures. In Q3, we've seen a plateau in consumer demand, challenges in the supply chain, and the rising cost of fulfillment,\" Elston says.\n\n\n\nI am bullish on AMZN stock. (See Analysts\u2019 Top Stocks on TipRanks)\n\n\n\nBig Spending on Staff Recruitment and Retention\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Elston thinks that Amazon's business will soon turn around, thanks to big investments the company has made in people and a rebound in online spending in the holiday season. \n\n\n\n\"To mitigate the effects of these forces, Amazon has invested heavily in staff recruitment, increased wages, and deployed powerful (and expensive) retention programs like free college tuition,\" Elston says. \n\n\n\nHe continued, \"While these expenditures have impacted Q3 earnings, they will set Amazon up to succeed in Q4 and beyond; 42% of shoppers in the U.S. plan to spend more money on gifts this holiday season compared to 2020. Maintaining a positive customer experience, and managing shopper expectations requires manpower and morale \u2014 both of which were bolstered by Amazon's Q3 spending.\"\n\n\n\nSean Turner, CTO of Swiftly, a digital loyalty platform for brick-and-mortar grocers, is on the same page, pointing to Amazon's gaining momentum in the grocery business. \n\n\n\n\"Despite slowing earnings, Amazon is showing momentum in the grocery space,\" he says. \"The digital leader is steadily expanding its line of Fresh grocery locations to bolster sales both online and in brick-and-mortar stores, combining technology and convenience to lure customers away from their local retailer -- especially as supply chain issues cause prices to rise and consumers spending behavior to change.\"\n\n\n\nTipRanks' Smart Score\n\n\n\nInvestors have been lukewarm on Amazon's shares recently. Its shares have gained a meager 8% so far this year compared to a 25% gain of the S&P500. Investors have anticipated Amazon's challenges, choosing to stay on the sidelines rather than chase after its shares.\n\n\n\nTipRanks' Smart Score assigns Amazon a perfect 10, citing solid and fundamental factors and increased hedge fund activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWall Street's Take\n\n\n\nTurning to Wall Street, Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 29 Buys assigned in the past three months. The average Amazon price target of $4075.34 implies 15.8% upside potential.\n\n\n\nAnalyst price targets range from a low of $3,800.00 per share to a high of $4,500.00 per share.\n\n\n\nThat's much better than the 8% it has gained thus far this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: At the time of publication, Panos Mourdoukoutas didn\u2019t own shares of Amazon.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained in this article represents the views and opinion of the writer only, and not the views or opinion of TipRanks or its affiliates, and should be considered for informational purposes only.

    "summary": "Large U.S. corporations, including Microsoft\u00a0(MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) (now Meta), and Tesla (TSLA), have reported their quarterly earnings. While Microsoft, Google, and Tesla zoomed past estimates, Apple, Meta, and Amazon disappointed.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThough these companies may not have solid quarterly performance in common, they are under a lot of scrutiny due to their global operations and large scale. Further, geopolitical events, complex international laws, and economic cycles directly hurt their brand image, financials, and operating conditions.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThus, it is prudent to keep an eye on the evolving risk factors of these corporations, as ascertaining risks ahead of investing enhances the odds of winning in the market.\n\n\n\nUsing the TipRanks\u2019 new and dynamic Risk Factors tool and looking at the risk distribution profile of these companies, it is clear that Apple is the only company, among the above-mentioned companies, that has added two\u00a0new risks\u00a0post its recent quarterly earnings.\n\n\n\nHighlighting the increased scrutiny on the technology sector, Apple, in a recent SEC filing, stated that it is subject to \u201cintense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\u201d Further, this may harm its brand reputation.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAdditionally, under its Sales & Marketing sub-category, Apple stated that its failure to offer appealing digital content to its customers could negatively impact its financial and operating performances.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that Apple offers a variety of digital content through its app store and subscription-based services. Further, it launched a personalized fitness service, including Apple Fitness.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDuring the Q4 conference call, Apple\u2019s CFO Luca Maestri stated that the company is seeing \u201cincreased customer engagement\u201d for its services. Further, the paid accounts on its digital content stores marked double-digit growth and reached an all-time high during Q4 in each geographic segment.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNoting the strong growth in its paid subscriptions, Maestri stated that Apple now has over \u201c745 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform,\u201d up 160 million year-over-year.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOverall, Apple\u2019s risk distribution profile indicates that factors including its Ability to Sell, Production, and Macro & Political place it in a higher risk zone. All these risk factors are well above the sector benchmark.\n\n\n\nHowever, its Legal & Regulatory, Tech & Innovation, and Finance & Corporate risks are well below the sector benchmark.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on TipRanks, Apple stock has a rating consensus of Strong Buy, based on 19 Buys and 6 Holds. Additionally, Apple scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Smart Score\u00a0rating system, indicating that it will likely outperform the market.\n\n\n\nSee Top Smart Score stocks >>\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0average Apple price target\u00a0of $168.91 implies 12.8% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure: On the date of publication, Amit Singh had no position in any of the companies discussed in this article.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained in this article represents the views and opinion of the writer only, and not the views or opinion of TipRanks or its affiliates, and should be considered for informational purposes only.

Public money would go to provide incentives for manufacturing and research in the U.S.Semiconductor production and plant locations have increasingly come into focus amid shortages that have hurt shipments of everything from iPhones to pickup trucks, caused by spikes in demand as parts of the economy recover from the depths of the pandemic. The U.S. is home to companies that dominate the chip industry\u2019s revenue, while the majority of manufacturing of the crucial electronic components is done in Asia.Technology companies want the government to partially foot the bill for stemming a slide in U.S. production, which has seen its share of the market drop to 12% from 37% in 1990, according to the SIA. But they don\u2019t want government to step in to mandate where more immediate chip supply is channeled. Automakers, who weren\u2019t mentioned as members of the coalition in SIAC\u2019s release, have lobbied to have semiconductor output assigned to their needs to help return their plants back to full production.\u201cThe current shortage of semiconductors is impacting a broad range of industries throughout the economy. To address this problem in the short term, government should refrain from intervening as industry works to correct the current supply-demand imbalance causing the shortage,\u201d the new organization said in the statement provided by the SIA. \u201cBut for the longer term, robust funding of the CHIPS Act would help America build the additional capacity necessary to have more resilient supply chains to ensure critical technologies will be there when we need them.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Google\u2019s results, showing a surge in ad sales related to travel and retail, offered a glimpse of online spending in a post-pandemic world: Businesses are boosting digital marketing to capture a public eager to resume something resembling normal life again.Google parent Alphabet Inc. said first-quarter revenue, excluding payments to distribution partners, came in at $45.6 billion, pummeling Wall Street estimates. The company also unveiled a big new share buyback, sending the stock up more than 4% in extended trading.Covid-19 restrictions have limited travel and trips to physical stores, two key areas of Google\u2019s search business. However, Alphabet shares are up more than 30% this year on optimism vaccinations in the U.S. are reviving these activities. The company is also pushing further into e-commerce, but still lags behind rival Amazon.com Inc.While most major tech companies thrived during the pandemic, Alphabet\u2019s performance was uneven. YouTube ad revenue boomed as people were stuck at home looking to relieve boredom by watching videos online. Google\u2019s cloud-computing business also grew quickly on a spike in demand for internet-based services from remote workers. However, the online search engine dwarfs these other operations and it suffered from a slump in commercial queries for things like flights and hotels.Now, with more than 1 billion Covid-19 vaccine shots given, according to Bloomberg\u2019s vaccine tracker, consumers have started to venture out to restaurants, shops and even vacation destinations -- and they often interact with Google services and ads before they do.Ruth Porat, chief financial officer, said the results \u201creflect elevated consumer activity online and broad based growth in advertiser revenue.\u201dDuring a conference call with analysts, Porat said it\u2019s unclear how \u201cdurable\u201d the recent change in consumer behavior will be, because it will depend on the global pace of the Covid-19 recovery.The Alphabet board authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $50 billion of its Class C capital stock. The shares climbed 4.2% in extended trading, after closing at $2,290.98 in New York earlier on Tuesday. That puts the stock on course for another record on Wednesday and values the company at more than $1.5 trillion.Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai is trying to expand beyond the advertising engine that generates most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, while contending with a regulatory backlash that includes three government antitrust suits targeting different parts of its business in the U.S. He\u2019s also preparing to bring employees back to the office in September.Search and other related businesses generated sales of $31.9 billion in the first quarter. Wall Street estimated $29.9 billion.YouTube ad revenue surged 49% to $6 billion. Analysts were looking for $5.7 billion. YouTube Shorts, its competitor to TikTok, logged 6.5 billion daily views as of March, up from 3.5 billion at the end of 2020.The company\u2019s cloud division, led by Thomas Kurian, is wooing corporations and other large customers in a bid to catch market leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Google Cloud revenue jumped to $4 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations.Executives said the Google Play store, YouTube\u2019s non-ad revenue and consumer hardware were the top drivers of growth in the \u201cGoogle Other\u201d category.Alphabet\u2019s Other Bets, such as autonomous vehicles and delivery drones, generated revenue of $198 million. That division lost $1.15 billion.Alphabet overall generated $17.9 billion of net income, or $26.29 a share, in the most recent quarter, compared with $6.8 billion, or $9.87 a share, a year earlier.(Updates with more details on the shares in eighth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "summary": "Amazon.com has taken to the courts once again in a bid to get a $10 billion Pentagon contract that was awarded to Microsoft invalidated, according to Reuters.In a redacted court filing from October 23rd that was unsealed yesterday, Amazon (AMZN) reiterated its stance that the awarding of the contract to Microsoft (MSFT) must be overturned because it was granted in bad faith and that President Donald Trump used his influence to manipulate the contract.Trump has publicly criticized the company and Amazon head, Jeff Bezos in the past. Amazon has called the decision flawed and politically corrupt.Amazon was a front-runner to win the contract and filed its initial lawsuit in November 2019, after the contract was awarded to Miscrosoft. A judge granted Amazon\u2019s request to temporarily halt the deal from moving forward in February.The Defense Department stated in a court-ordered re-evaluation in September that Microsoft\u2019s proposal represented the best value for the government. Amazon responded on Tuesday saying that its cloud computing solutions are the lowest priced by tens of millions of dollars.Microsoft retorted by saying, \u201ccareer procurement officials at the DoD (Department of Defense) decided that given the superior technical advantages and overall value, we continued to offer the best solution.\u201dNeither the White House nor the Pentagon has offered any comment thus far. (See AMZN stock analysis on TipRanks)Cowen analyst John Blackledge reiterated his Buy rating 2 days ago and raised his price target from $4,150 to $4,350 (37% upside potential). He named the shares a \u201cBest Idea for 2021.\u201dConsensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 36 Buys and 1 Hold. The average price target of $3,825.60 implies a potential upside of around 21% over the next 12 months.Related News:Freehold Royalties Ramps Up Dividend By 33%; Street Remains BullishOllie\u2019s Bargain Boosts Share Repurchase Plan By $100MPalantir vs Verint: Which SaaS Stock Is A Better Pick?",

    "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. projected a steep jump in sales in the current quarter, topping analysts\u2019 estimates, indicating the retailer expects the surge in online shopping during the pandemic to extend through the holiday season.The company also warned that adjustments to its operations and greater spending due to Covid-19 would continue to weigh on its profitability. Amazon\u2019s operating income forecast fell short of analyst estimates, sending shares down about 1.5% in extended trading.Revenue will be $112 billion to $121 billion in the period ending in December, Amazon said Thursday in a statement. Analysts, on average, estimated $112.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Researcher EMarketer Inc. projected U.S. e-commerce sales will surge 36% to a record $190 billion during the holiday season.Amazon has thrived during the pandemic as people avoided stores and shopped online, stocking up on goods from electronics to groceries. The company posted record sales and earnings during the second quarter, comforting investors even though Amazon spent prodigiously on new warehouses to meet surging demand and incurred higher costs hiring hundreds of thouands of workers and keeping those employees safe.Andrew Lipsman, a principal analyst at EMarketer, said he suspects Amazon is being conservative with its guidance, even the upbeat sales forecast. The company\u2019s projections, and rising U.S. Covid-19 infection rates that may depress in-store shopping, are creating an expectation for a blowout holiday quarter for Amazon, and online retail generally, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing growth rates in e-commerce coming down,\u201d Lipsman added.Amazon said fourth-quarter operating income will range from $1 billion to $4.5 billion, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $5.95 billion. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said discounts offered during the Prime Day sale -- which Amazon moved to October from its usual place in July -- also will be a drag on profitability in the current quarter.Investors traditionally focus on Amazon\u2019s costs, fearing that the company\u2019s spending will cut into its profit. Shares declined to a low of $3,141.30 in extended trading after closing at $3,211.01 in New York. The stock has gained 71% this year.Amazon said it expected to absorb some $4 billion in costs related to Covid-19 during the quarter, up from $2.5 billion in the third quarter. Shipping expenses jumped 57% to $15.1 billion in the period ended Sept. 30, a steeper increase than the 37% gain in revenue.Olsavsky said Amazon\u2019s gauge of Covid costs goes beyond providing personal protective equipment and testing of employees, and includes elements like lost productivity from adjusted break times and social distancing in warehoues.Amazon also reported it crossed the 1 million employee mark, with 1,125,300 full- and part-time workers at the end of the quarter, up 50% from a year ago.The world\u2019s largest online retailer posted third-quarter revenue of $96.1 billion, up from almost $70 billion a year earlier. Net income was $12.37 a share. Analysts projected $7.55 a share on sales of $92.7 billion.Analysts widely expect the holiday shopping rush to test the capacity of the U.S. logistics system to accomodate a surge in home delivery. Olsavsky said Amazon was not \u201ctotally insulated\u201d from those trends, but the company had spent heavily this year on its own capacity, opening staging and sorting facilities closer to big cities. \u201cIt does behoove shoppers to shop early,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested a lot to be ready.\u201dSales by Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing unit that in recent years has accounted for most of Amazon\u2019s operating income, rose 29% to $11.6 billion.(Updates with comments from analyst in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "source": "Yahoo",
    "summary": "Earnings season is almost in full swing \u2014 and a range of notable names are lined up to report results. One worth watching is none other than Amazon (AMZN), which will post its quarterly figures on Thursday, July 23.  The stakes are high for the e-commerce giant, as its stock has been soaring over 60% so far this year. Can the company\u2019s latest results live up to expectations? Cowen analyst John Blackledge expects Amazon to march on defiantly when it reports 2Q earnings on July 23.\u201cWe expect strong 2Q20 results with Revenue & Operating Income above high end of guide range. Key revenue drivers include AWS, Advertising, Subscription, & accelerating eCom growth (+29% year-over-year vs. +17% year-over-year in 2Q19) given continued COVID-19 demand surge. Our 2Q20 Operating Income forecast is driven by AWS, Ad biz & 3P mix shift offset by COVID investments,\u201d Blackledge said.And that\u2019s not really much of a surprise. If any company has been COVID proof, it has been the e-commerce giant. The surge in demand during the pandemic\u2019s initial wave has been well documented and with the virus still amongst us, it is safe to say demand for Amazon\u2019s services won\u2019t decelerate any time soon.That said, Amazon\u2019s expenses have also increased significantly during the period. These will act as a costly counterpoint to the increased sales, as spending on infrastructure, workers\u2019 safety, extra pay, and an expanded workforce are sure to impact the bottom line.Despite an outlay expected to reach $4 billion, Blackledge expects \u201cinvestors to look past the 2Q investments in COVID-19 related expenses.\u201dOverall, for 2Q20, the 5-star analyst calls for revenue of $81.3 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase and above the high end of Amazon\u2019s guidance of between $75 billion to $81 billion. The estimate is also 0.8% above consensus.Blackledge expects a beat on operating income, too, forecasting $2.1 billion, down 32.8% year-year-year, but still 38% above the high end of Amazon\u2019s guidance of $1.5 billion. The figure is also way higher than the consensus estimate of $952 million.Accordingly, Blackledge reiterated an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Amazon and increased the price target from $2,750 to $3,700 \u2013 Wall Street\u2019s most optimistic target right now. The figure implies upside potential of 26% in the year ahead. (To watch Blackledge\u2019s track record, click here)The sentiment remains bullish among Blackledge\u2019s colleagues. Based on 2 Holds, a lone Sell, and a resounding 37 Buys, Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating. Surprisingly, the analysts expect shares to decline by 1%, based on the $2,980.47 average price target.

    "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. won its court fight over a record 13 billion-euro ($14.9 billion) Irish tax bill in a crushing blow to European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager\u2019s crackdown on preferential fiscal deals for companies.The judgment by the EU\u2019s lower court on Wednesday vindicates Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook\u2019s challenge against a decision he labeled as \u201cpolitical crap.\u201dWhile the EU General Court\u2019s ruling can still be appealed, judges delivered a stinging attack on the European Commission for failing to show \u201cto the requisite legal standard\u201d that Ireland\u2019s tax deal broke state-aid law by giving Apple an unfair advantage.\u201cThe commission\u2019s intent seemed to be a political one: to punish Apple for its overall tax planning, rather than to reach a result that accorded with the legal or economic position,\u201d Dan Neidle, a tax lawyer with Clifford Chance said in a statement. \u201cThe court has, quite rightly, followed the law and not any wider political objectives.\u201dThe EU-Apple Battle Over a $14.9 Billion Tax Bill: ExplainedThe Apple case is the hallmark of Vestager\u2019s five-year campaign to get rid of allegedly unfair tax deals that some EU governments dole out to favored multinationals including the likes of Amazon.com Inc. Apple\u2019s fury at its 2016 tax bill led Cook to blast the EU move.The EU will consider its next steps after studying the Luxembourg-based court\u2019s judgment, Vestager said in a statement.\u201cIf member states give certain multinational companies tax advantages not available to their rivals, this harms fair competition,\u201d she said, adding that the EU \u201cwill continue to look at aggressive tax planning measures under EU state aid rules.\u201dApple said the case \u201cwas not about how much tax we pay, but where we are required to pay it.\u201d The firm \u201chas paid more than $100 billion in corporate income taxes around the world in the last decade and tens of billions more in other taxes.\u201dApple shares rose 2 percent to $396 in premarket trading.The Cupertino, California-based company had argued the EU wrongly targeted profits that should be taxed in the U.S. and \u201cretroactively changed the rules\u201d on how global authorities calculate what\u2019s owed to them.The Irish finance ministry said the nation \u201chas always been clear that there was no special treatment provided to the two Apple\u201d units in the EU\u2019s state-aid case. The ruling is a vindication for the country, which had been criticized by puzzled voters who couldn\u2019t fathom why the country wouldn\u2019t accept a windfall from one of the globe\u2019s richest companies.Ireland Loses Apple Billions, But Wins Tax Vindication for NowApple\u2019s huge sales -- like those of other U.S. tech giants -- have attracted particular scrutiny in Europe, focusing on complicated company structures for transferring profits generated from intellectual property.The case comes as Apple is getting close to overtaking Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil company in market valuation, a milestone that would make the technology giant the world\u2019s largest company by that measure. Its shares have rallied about 30% this year on broad optimism about its businesses.Before today Vestager already had a mixed record in the court cases that followed her tax orders. The Dane suffered a setback last year when judges faulted a decision targeting Starbucks Corp. over its tax deals with the Netherlands. But the tribunal upheld the EU\u2019s decision concerning Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\u2019s tax affairs in Luxembourg.\u201cVestager has made a very valiant effort to use the tools that were at her disposal but we all knew from the start that those tools were not meant for the purpose,\u201d said Sophie in \u2019t Veld, a Dutch member of the EU Parliament\u2019s Liberal group.She said the decision will be welcomed by Ireland, but \u201cI cannot see how you can be happy that you let a tech giant off the hook when we\u2019re talking about paying 13 billion euros -- it will have to be coughed up by taxpayers now.\u201dThe cases are: T-778/16, Ireland v. Commission, T-892/16, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe v. Commission.(Updates with background, lawyer comment starting in second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Trading ideas are stacking up for what\u2019s set to be a difficult second-quarter earnings season featuring a wide variation in performance due to the coronavirus pandemic.Stocks have surged from March\u2019s lows despite the bleakest profit outlook since the global financial crisis, with S&P; 500 earnings expected to drop about 44%. Megacap technology firms led the stimulus-fueled rally and a key debate is whether they will keep that role as the earnings picture becomes clearer.\u201cFor all but a fortunate few -- notably among the FAANGs -- the earnings numbers will be abysmal,\u201d Tan Kai Xian, a statistician and U.S. analyst at Gavekal Research, wrote in a note, using a common acronym for big tech stocks. But there\u2019s a \u201creasonable prospect\u201d of brighter estimates and positive second-half surprises, which would support stock prices, he said.Here\u2019s a rundown of some recent thinking going into the earnings season:Performance ReversalJulian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG LLC, raises the prospect of leaders and laggards swapping roles, after stocks such as eBay Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. rallied 20% or more from a June 8 peak in the S&P; 500, while companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and General Motors Co. fell more than 10% over the period.\u201cWe view earnings season as a potential catalyst for performance reversion,\u201d he wrote in a note, while also adding that \u201cif 2020 has taught us anything, it is that anything can happen -- and probably will.\u201dTech Risk?Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, flags the possibility that disappointing earnings and guidance from technology companies may be an \u201cunderappreciated\u201d risk. Investors should consider adding gold, corporate credit and non-U.S. stocks to portfolios that are overweight the S&P; 500, she wrote in a note.OptionsAmy Wu Silverman, derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, sees an opportunity for investors to use the current high premiums in call options in their favor. Specifically, she recommends call spreads on Amazon and Netflix Inc. -- a strategy that involves both buying and selling the bullish options but with different strike prices -- as a way to profit from further modest gains in their stock prices.Long FinancialsEvercore ISI strategists led by Dennis DeBusschere have recommended going long financials into the earnings season because \u201cthere\u2019s upside potential for a battered-down sector that\u2019s priced in negative headlines already.\u201dIndustrialsStuart Kaiser, head of equity derivatives research at UBS Securities LLC, recommends call options on the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund to position for upside in earnings, as the firm\u2019s \u201cbig data\u201d analysis shows revenue for industrials above consensus heading into the reporting season.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Some workers at Whole Foods Market stores across the U.S. called in sick on Tuesday, part of a coordinated action to demand more sick pay and protections for grocery store employees working through the coronavirus pandemic.It\u2019s unclear how many people participated. An organizer said they didn\u2019t have an estimate, and a Whole Foods spokeswoman didn't provide a tally, but said the strike hadn't disrupted operations.Bloomberg News interviewed workers in five states, from Illinois and Texas to the Eastern Seaboard, who say they joined colleagues calling in sick. They cite as reasons for participating fear of contracting or spreading the coronavirus to family members and disputes with managers\u00a0about appropriate measure to protect themselves, among other things.\u00a0The sickout strike is the latest in a string of efforts by employees of businesses that remain open during the pandemic to extract protections and better working conditions from their employers. Workers at Perdue Farms Inc., McDonald\u2019s Corp., and General Electric Co. have protested. Walmart Inc. said this week it was experiencing higher than normal absenteeism among its workforce, but that it was \"manageable.\" On Monday, some employees at Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Staten Island, New York, warehouse walked off the job to protest the company\u2019s handling of coronavirus cases in the facility.Organizers of the Whole Foods action have circulated a petition\u00a0signed by more than 10,500 people asking for paid leave for all workers who choose to\u00a0isolate themselves, health care coverage for part-time employees and funds to cover testing and treatment of sick team members. Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon,\u00a0in January stopped providing health care benefits for part-time employees who work less than 30 hours a week.\u00a0The upscale grocer has rolled out temporary raises of $2 an hour through April, increased overtime compensation, and says employees placed in\u00a0quarantine or diagnosed with Covid-19 are eligible for two weeks of paid sick leave, policies in place throughout Amazon\u2019s workforce.\u00a0Rachel Malish, a\u00a0Whole Foods spokeswoman, on Tuesday pointed to those actions\u00a0and others the company says it\u2019s taking to safeguard employees. \u201cSo far today we have seen no changes to overall absenteeism and we continue to operate all of our stores without interruption,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cThere is no higher priority for us than taking care of our Team Members.\u201d\u00a0Malish said the critiques from \u201ca small but vocal group\u201d\u00a0don\u2019t accurately reflect the collective view of the grocer\u2019s\u00a095,000 employees.\u00a0One Whole Foods worker in the Chicago area who joined the strike on Tuesday said working at the grocer felt like a public service a few weeks ago, when aisles were full of shoppers panic buying.\u00a0But as business slowed to a more normal level\u2014and the virus\u00a0spread to\u00a0communities across the country\u2014the employee no longer thinks coming to work is worth the risk.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for people to stay safe,\u201d the employee said. \u201cWorkers are being forced to choose between their safety and the safety of their loved ones and being able to pay their bills.\u201dThe worker spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from her employer. Some Whole Foods workers said Amazon\u2019s firing on Monday of Chris Smalls, an organizer of the Amazon walkout in Staten Island, made them reluctant to speak publicly. Amazon says he was dismissed for violating the terms of an company-ordered quarantine after he was sent home with pay for coming into contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19. Smalls disputes that.\u00a0Strike organizers also called for Whole Foods to shut down any store where a worker tests positive for Covid-19, a demand grocery workers share with some of their colleagues employed in Amazon\u2019s logistics network. Amazon, which says it\u2019s doing enhanced cleaning of its facilities, has opted to keep warehouses where employees tested positive open, over the objection of some employees scared to return.\u00a0The strike was called for by Whole Worker, a coalition of current and former employees that has been working to organize workers \u00a0since 2018, initially with aid from the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. An RWDSU spokeswoman said the New York based union isn\u2019t involved in Tuesday\u2019s action. Whole Foods, whose chief executive John Mackey once said was \u201cbeyond unions,\u201d has resisted prior efforts by workers to organize, a similar stance to its corporate parent.(Updates with comments from Whole Foods spokeswoman)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.",

First of all, they're the two hottest Pokemon games out right now. Second of all, everyone's talking about it. To help celebrate Pokemon Day, the Legendary Mewtwo will appear in Max Raid dens for a short amount of time, and three starter Pokemon will join him: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. If you manage to defeat them you'll get some great rewards, and people are going nuts chatting about it on social media. Of course, none of this matters if you're in the dark because you don't have Pokemon Sword or Pokemon Shield. Everyone knows how fun Pokemon games are, and events like this new Max Raid are awesome ways to add new experiences to the games following their initial release. But you obviously can't appreciate that if you don't own either title, which is perhaps why Amazon is currently offering the first discounts we've seen in a long time on both titles.",

But while some retail stocks may be in terminal decline, weakness in others may end up being a huge long-term buying opportunity.

    "summary": "Amazon India and Flipkart are studying the Budget proposal on levy of one per cent TDS, and will reach out to the government for clarifications. \"We are studying the details, and will reach out to the government for clarifications. We hope the tax regime is simple and uniform so that millions of small and medium businesses can go online, digitise their operations and continue to contribute to growing the economy,\" an Amazon India spokesperson said in response to an e-mailed query. Flipkart also said it was going through the proposal. \"We are studying the details, particularly how it impacts the MSMEs and Sellers on our marketplace platform. We will discuss further with our seller partners, and engage with government and other stakeholders in due course,\" Flipkart said in its response. The government on Saturday proposed a new levy of 1 per cent TDS (tax deducted at source) on e-commerce transactions, a move that could increase burden on sellers on such platforms. \"In order to widen and deepen the tax net by bringing participants of e-commerce (sellers) within tax net, it is proposed to insert a new section 194-O in the Act so as to provide for a new levy of TDS at the rate of one per cent,\" according to Budget 2020-21 documents.",

This isn't just a bit of teasing, \"this is a whole different level,\" she said. The problem is that Amazon chose a popular human name for its artificial intelligent software bot. And now the name \"Alexa\" has become synonymous with \"servant,\" another parent told Business Insider, which inspires adults and children to universally bark out orders, tease, joke and bully humans named Alexa, parents and adults named Alexa say. \"If we had named our child Servant, we'd be all over the news,\" the mom says. Business Insider talked to half a dozen of parents and adults named Alexa and discovered just how difficult their lives have become since Amazon's AI has zoomed to popularity. A teen discussed the sexual harassment she's endured, which isn't helped by headlines and product advertising that use double entendres, playing on Alexa's female voice.",

The EU is a strictly European idea, designed to bring peace and prosperity to a region ravaged by centuries of incessant war. It was meant to mind its own business, leaving matters of global import to the two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Britain and France. Under this arrangement, the EU achieved stability for its neighborhood. While other countries have pursued global political and economic strategies, we Europeans have relied on our shared history, democratic traditions, and moral compass in the service of fitful regional integration . But these strengths will not ensure Europe\u2019s continued relevance. Economic change and technological advances (online platforms, artificial intelligence, automation, data monopolies, zero-marginal-cost distribution) are reshaping the global economy, upending longstanding power structures, and fueling political disruption within many countries.",

    "summary": "Environmental, health and community groups attending a much-anticipated hearing Dec. 12 on a controversial rule requiring medium- and heavy-duty truck manufacturers to make zero-emissions vehicles an increasing percentage of their California sales panned the standard as ineffective. As the standard is currently written, zero-emission truck/chassis sales would need to be 7% of Class 4 to Class 8 straight truck sales and 3% of all other truck sales by 2024. By 2030, they would need to be 50% of Class 4-8 straight trucks sales and 15% of all other truck sales. During the California Air Resources Board (CARB) hearing, held in Sacramento, dozens of people criticized the targets, arguing that implementing a 50% sales standard by 2030 means that only 4% of the approximately 2 million medium- and heavy-duty trucks on the road would be zero-emissions vehicles. That figure, critics said, is not enough to help meet state greenhouse gas emissions goals or cut the pollution impacting low-income and minority communities in so-called \" diesel death zones ,\" areas of Southern California with high levels of truck pollution. \"We need a sales target that doesn't ignore our lived community,\" testified one community member representing an environmental justice group.",
