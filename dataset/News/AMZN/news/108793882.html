<p>Jennifer Abruzzo, general counsel of the NLRB, said in a memo that so-called captive audience meetings discourage employees from exercising their right to refrain from listening to anti-union messages, making them illegal under federal labor law.</p>
<p>"This license to coerce is an anomaly in labor law, inconsistent with the (law's) protection of employees' free choice," wrote Abruzzo, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Abruzzo said that in a future case she will ask the five-member NLRB to overturn its own precedent going back to the 1940s that says captive audience meetings are legal. The general counsel acts as a prosecutor, filing complaints against businesses that are then heard by the board.</p>
<p>The NLRB in past cases has said the meetings are a valid exercise of employers' free-speech rights, but Abruzzo said those decisions failed to balance those rights with the ability of workers to freely choose whether to join unions.</p>
<p>The memo comes amid a spate of high-profile union campaigns involving companies such as Amazon.com Inc and Starbucks Corp, both of which have reportedly held https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/union-says-amazon-continues-interfere-with-election-alabama-warehouse-2022-02-22 captive audience meetings. Some studies have estimated that more than 90% of employers facing union elections hold mandatory anti-union meetings.</p>
<p>Amazon and Starbucks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said in a statement on Thursday that employers use captive audience meetings to spread disinformation and intimidate workers.</p>
<p>"The question of whether workers want a union should be the workers' choice - not the employers' - free of intimidation and interference," he said.</p>
