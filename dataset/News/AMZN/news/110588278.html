<p>--Amazon.com Inc. informed more than half a dozen senior managers involved with the Staten Island warehouse that they were being fired, the New York Times reported Friday, citing four people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>--The firings were seen by the managers and other people who work at the facility as a response to Amazon Labor Union's victory in establishing the company's first union in the U.S., the report said, adding that the firings occurred outside of the company's typical employee-review cycle.</p>
<p>--Many of the managers had been responsible for implementing the company's response to the unionization effort that was taking place, the New York Times reported.</p>
<p>--An Amazon spokeswoman said the company made the management changes after it had spent several weeks evaluating aspects of the "operations and leadership" at JFK8, which is the company's name for the warehouse, the report said. "Part of our culture at Amazon is to continually improve, and we believe it's important to take time to review whether or not we're doing the best we could be for our team," said Kelly Nantel, the spokeswoman, according to the report.</p>
