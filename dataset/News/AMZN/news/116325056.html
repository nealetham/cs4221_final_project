<p>New service makes it easier for automotive companies to collect, transform, and transfer vehicle data to the cloud in near real time, enabling improved vehicle quality and autonomy.</p>
<p>Bridgestone, Hyundai Motor Group, LG CNS, and Renesas Electronics Corporation among customers using AWS IoT FleetWise</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced the general availability of AWS IoT FleetWise, a new service that makes it easier for automotive companies to collect, transform, and transfer vehicle data to the cloud in near real time. Automakers, suppliers, fleet operators, and technology solution vendors in the automotive industry can use AWS IoT FleetWise to collect and organize vehicle data more easily, and to store the data in a standardized way for data analysis in the cloud. AWS IoT FleetWise helps automotive companies efficiently transfer data to the cloud in near real time using the service's intelligent data-collection capabilities. These capabilities allow developers to reduce the amount of data transferred to the cloud by defining rules for when to collect and transfer it based on configurable parameters (e.g., vehicle temperature, speed, and type). Once the data is in the cloud, automotive companies can use it for applications that analyze vehicle fleet health to more quickly identify potential recalls or safety issues, make in-vehicle infotainment systems smarter, or improve advanced technologies like autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems with analytics and machine learning. There are no upfront costs to use AWS IoT FleetWise, and customers pay only for the underlying services used. To get started with AWS IoT FleetWise, visit aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise.</p>
<p>'Automotive companies want to use the broad portfolio of AWS services to help manage the vast amounts of data coming from connected vehicles, but they have lacked a solution that made it easier to collect, transform, and transfer data to the cloud,' said Mike Tzamaloukas, general manager of IoT automotive at AWS. 'Now, with AWS IoT FleetWise, customers can easily pinpoint the exact vehicle data they need and analyze it in a standardized format to gain actionable insights into the vehicle's health status and performance. Automotive companies can now use the data extracted through AWS IoT FleetWise to help improve vehicle quality, safety, and autonomy.'</p>
<p>Automotive companies have been collecting data from basic vehicle sensors for over a decade to evaluate operational and safety indicators like engine temperature and vehicle stability. Automotive companies today are building vehicles with advanced sensors (e.g., radar and cameras) that create vast amounts of data-in some cases up to 2 terabytes of data every hour. Automotive customers want to collect, standardize, and analyze this data in the cloud to quickly and easily derive insights that can help improve vehicle quality, safety, and autonomy. However, transferring this data to the cloud can be cost prohibitive and time consuming. Additionally, the growing variety of vehicle makes, models, and trims that generate data in different proprietary formats creates a complex array of data across vehicles. Collecting, transforming, and analyzing this data requires automotive companies to build custom data-collection systems, which is difficult and time-consuming. As a result, automotive companies are unable to use the data to help solve common problems like spotting fleet-wide issues before they become a bigger problem, tailoring infotainment content, and using data to improve vehicle performance.</p>
<p>AWS IoT FleetWise provides automotive companies with a managed service that makes it easier to collect, transform, and transfer data from millions of vehicles to the cloud in near real time. With AWS IoT FleetWise, automotive companies can access, structure, and standardize proprietary vehicle data without needing to develop custom data-collection systems. Customers can also integrate with AWS IoT FleetWise to enhance their existing systems. Automotive companies can get started in the AWS Management Console by defining and modeling vehicle attributes (e.g., a two-door coupe) and the sensors associated with the car's make, model, and trims (e.g., engine temperature, front-impact warning, parking assist system) for individual vehicle types or multiple vehicle types across their entire fleet. After vehicle modeling, automotive companies can connect the AWS IoT FleetWise application via the vehicle gateway (i.e., in-vehicle communications hub that monitors and collects data) or other data collection hubs in the vehicle, so it can read, decode, and transmit information to and from AWS. With AWS IoT FleetWise's intelligent data-collection controls, automotive companies can select the exact data they need for their use cases and limit the amount of data transferred to the cloud by creating conditional rules (e.g., sensor data from hard-braking events associated with a vehicle make and model). Once data is transferred to the cloud with AWS IoT FleetWise, automotive companies can use AWS's breadth and depth of analytics and machine learning services to extract value from vehicle data. For example, automotive companies can collect data from electric-vehicle batteries when the temperature drops below freezing and then analyze it and run simulations in the cloud to improve battery performance in cold weather.</p>
