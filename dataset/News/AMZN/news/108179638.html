<p>Additional eero 6 Series Features and Benefits</p>
<p>All eero 6 series devices work with your existing internet service and offer several features to unlock your wifi's potential, including:</p>
<p>Easy to set up. Setting up your new eero takes just minutes with in-app instructions. Simply unplug your old router and connect your eero router to your modem. Sign in to the app, and you're ready to go-no expertise required.</p>
<p>Backward compatible. eero 6 series devices are backward compatible with previous generation eero devices, and you can easily expand your network by adding more eero devices when your wifi needs change. You can also swap your existing eero gateway with a newer eero router without tearing down your existing network.</p>
<p>TrueMesh. All eero devices use patented eero TrueMesh networking technology to intelligently route network traffic to reduce congestion, buffering, and drop-offs, so you can stream in 4K, play games, and video conference with ease.</p>
<p>Easy to manage your network. You can use the eero app to manage your network, pause the internet, share your network with friends or guests, and more-whether you're at home or on the go. With the eero skill for Alexa, you can use an Alexa-enabled device or the Alexa app to manage eero features with your voice. For example, simply say, 'Alexa, ask eero to pause Tommy's profile' to pause internet access on all devices in Tommy's profile.</p>
<p>Frustration-Free Setup. After linking your eero account with your Amazon account, enabled devices instantly join the network and stay connected when you change your network name or password.</p>
<p>Seamlessly manage your smart home. Featuring a built-in Zigbee smart home hub, all eero 6 series devices can connect compatible smart home devices on your network with Alexa, so you don't need a separate Zigbee hub. eero 6 devices can also act as a Thread border router to provide interoperability with Matter-certified devices.</p>
