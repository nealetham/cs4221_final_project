<p>Release date -11072024</p>
<p>SEATTLE-Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), today announced the launch of AWS GenAI Lofts, a global tour designed to foster innovation and community in the evolving landscape of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This initiative will bring collaborative pop-up spaces to key AI hotspots around the world, offering developers, startups, and AI enthusiasts a platform to learn, build, and connect. Visitors will benefit from immersive experiences showcasing cutting-edge generative AI projects, workshops, fireside chats, and hands-on programming from AI experts, community groups, AWS Partners, including Anthropic, Cerebral Valley, Weights &amp; Biases, and venture capital investors.</p>
<p>Expected to attract thousands of visitors globally, AWS GenAI Lofts expand on AWS's recent commitment of $230 million to accelerate the creation of generative AI applications by startups around the world. The tour will operate as a traveling residency, setting up in top technology and innovation hubs for up to 12 weeks, with pop-ups opening for two weeks starting on July 29, 2024 in Bengaluru followed by an eight-week availability in San Francisco on August 12, 2024, then moving on to Sao Paulo, London, and Paris.</p>
<p>Each city will host a roster of esteemed AI experts and thought leaders, including machine learning data scientists, providing unprecedented access to some of the brightest minds in the field with daily events over the course of the residency. Visitors can also leverage the Ask an Expert Bar to get their questions answered by AWS Solutions Architects.</p>
<p>'I'm always inspired by the way in-person events spark new ideas when we bring together builders, startups, investors, AWS experts and our partners,' said Adam Seligman, AWS vice president, developer experience. 'Part of our approach to generative AI, as exemplified by Amazon Bedrock, is to give our customers the widest range of models and tools. By creating these hubs of activity, we aim to accelerate the development of generative AI technologies and foster a truly global community of creators. Now, innovators around the globe can really go deeper on their generative AI goals, learn how AWS can help them become a reality, and forge meaningful connections in their community that extend long beyond the tour itself.'</p>
<p>AWS Partners and community groups will be a core part of the programming for the AWS GenAI Lofts. Select organizations will host and co-host events through each city's pop-up. Visitors will have the opportunity to experience demonstrations of leading generative AI models, including AWS Partner Anthropic's family of models, Claude, which are available on Amazon Bedrock. Known for their advanced language models, Anthropic has quickly established itself as a leader in responsible AI development.</p>
<p>'The AWS GenAI Lofts are unique spaces for entrepreneurs to explore AI's frontiers and real-world applications,' said Jo Zhu, head of startup growth and partnerships at Anthropic. 'As part of this community, Anthropic is eager to engage and work directly with innovators as they use Claude to address real-world challenges with trusted and responsible AI. It's inspiring to see startups use these AI tools, collaborate with peers, and develop technology to solve problems and come up with creative solutions.'</p>
<p>'It's inspiring to see how developers are using generative AI to solve some of the world's most complex challenges, and we recognize the power in fostering conversations about real-world applications of the technology,' said Shawn Lewis, chief technology officer and co-founder, Weights &amp; Biases. 'We're excited to contribute our expertise and resources to this global initiative and to accelerate the development of generative AI-powered applications within these developer communities. '</p>
<p>The GenAI Loft in San Francisco will allow visitors to see, feel, and touch generative AI through real-life applications. It will also host AWS Solution-Focused Immersion Days, providing hands-on experience using generative AI services, and three-day bootcamps tailored to both business and technical founders. Startup Talks will highlight personal aspects of the entrepreneurial journey, while incorporating the perspectives of investors and industry partners.</p>
<p>'The pace and scale of innovation in generative AI is incredible, and we've seen firsthand that you need a really strong community to test ideas and stay on top of the latest breakthroughs in the space,' said Ivan Porollo, co-founder of Cerebral Valley, one of San Francisco's premiere AI communities. 'AWS GenAI Lofts can bring the brightest minds in AI together here in San Francisco, which is a massive opportunity for the startup and developer communities to meet each other, incubate ideas and drive momentum in building the next generation of AI. We're excited to be a part of that.'</p>
<p>These multi-week pop-ups empower visitors to go deeper with these experts than they could at a one-day or virtual event, with programming scheduled to allow founders and developers to tailor their engagement around their ongoing work. As the tour visits each city, AWS aims to equip startups and developers with knowledge, resources, and connections to an energized local community of experts, enthusiasts, and investors to continue experimenting with generative AI and building with AWS.</p>
