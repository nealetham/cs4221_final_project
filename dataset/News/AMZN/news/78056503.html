<p>By Omar Abdel-Baqui</p>
<p>Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud-computing unit appeared to be down for thousands of users Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Downdetector, which tracks website outages, showed more than 11,300 reports of outages for Amazon Web Services just after 11 a.m. EST. The outages appeared to be concentrated in New York, Washington and Chicago, according to Downdetector.</p>
<p>Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>AWS, in an update on its status dashboard, said it began investigating increased error rates and console issues in the US-East-1 region at around 11:20 a.m. EST. It said it had identified the root cause of the issue, which was affecting its global console landing page. "We are actively working towards recovery," Amazon said.</p>
<p>The company said customers may be able to access consoles from other regions. Consoles allow users to manage Amazon Web Services and cloud computing tools.</p>
<p>By 11:50 a.m., outage reports on Downdetector had dipped slightly to around 9,800.</p>
<p>AWS serves as a platform for many businesses, including The Wall Street Journal. The service allows customers to rent computing, storage and network capabilities.</p>
<p>Investing platform Public.com said a widespread AWS outage has made its app unavailable. "We understand that this is frustrating or even stressful for our members and will do all we can to help keep you informed as AWS corrects the situation," the company said.</p>
