<h1>India's Future stares at bankruptcy as lenders reject $3.4 billion asset sale to Reliance</h1>

<p>Nearly 70% of Future Retail's secured lenders rejected the deal to sell the group's assets to market leader Reliance Industries, it said in a stock exchange filing.</p>
<p>"The deal has fallen through. There is no coming back from here for Future," said a person with direct knowledge of the voting process.</p>
<p>The deal did not receive the requisite 75% favourable votes from secured creditors, the source added.</p>
<p>Reliance did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The rejection by lenders comes amid a legal challenge by U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc which has accused Future of violating certain contracts by dealing with Reliance, run by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani.</p>
<p>Reliance in 2020 had sought to purchase Future's retail, wholesale and other assets in a $3.4 billion deal after Future was hard hit by the pandemic.</p>
<p>But Amazon soon obtained legal injunctions that stalled Future's deal with Reliance, sparking a series of legal battles at various forums, including an arbitration panel in Singapore.</p>
<p>In February, Reliance which had kept to the sidelines earlier in the dispute, suddenly took control of hundreds of Future stores, citing non-payment of rent, after assuming many of the leases held by cash-strapped Future.</p>
<p>That spooked bankers, some of whom have already initiated debt recovery proceedings against Future.</p>
<p>Future Group as a whole has more than $4 billion in debt and lenders have started classifying the loans as non-performing assets (NPA).</p>
<p>Lenders are getting ready for a lengthy battle in bankruptcy court which can take years to resolve, sources told Reuters earlier on Friday.</p>
