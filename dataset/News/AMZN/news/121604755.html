<h1>AI Leaders Commit To White House Supported Guidelines</h1>

<p>In coordination with the White House, several leaders in the artificial intelligence (AI) space have publicly committed to a voluntary set of guidelines relating to responsible development and deployment of AI. Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI made immediate public commitments focused on safety, security, and transparent development and use of AI technology, including:</p>
<p>The CEOs of Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI met with Vice President Kamala Harris in May 2023. The agreed to AI-safety suggestions correspond with the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework released by the Department of Commerce in January.</p>
<p>The companies noted that the new commitments would last until regulations covering substantially the same issues are enacted. When federal regulators will do so is an open question. While a draft of the European Union's AI Act is currently in negotiations between the Council of the EU and its Member States, and the Chinese government recently released a set of generative AI rules, U.S. legislators are still in the information gathering stage and not close to enacting a national AI law. The voluntary commitments are "designed to advance a generative AI legal and policy regime" so they may provide strong guidance as to the subject matter of future regulation that would be supported by the industry, or perhaps forestall regulation, with Congress less inclined to rush legislation if private actors are falling in line on their own. At the very least, commitments by Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI may set the tone for smaller AI companies that haven't been included in the White House conversations.</p>
