<h1>EBay expects revenue growth of up to 6% in 2023, launches digital wallet</h1>

</p>
<p>Analysts polled by Refinitiv estimated 2023 revenue of $10.95 billion, which indicates a growth of 5.5%.</p>
<p>EBay saw strong demand from the online shopping boom last year during the COVID-19 pandemic, but is now scrambling to sustain the momentum as people return to regular living.</p>
<p>Moreover, analysts have said that eBay, which is still in the early stages of product innovation, faces tough competition from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc.</p>
<p>EBay said the digital wallet would let customers use proceeds from their sales to conveniently purchase their next item or pay their selling expenses.</p>
<p>"We see incredibly compelling growth potential in this market," Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone said.</p>
<p>The company also launched eBay Vault, a digital marketplace and storage facility for trading cards and collectibles, which is expected to launch in the United States in the next quarter.</p>
<p>Shares of the company fell 1.1% to $52.5 in extended trading.</p>
<p>The company expects adjusted profit to rise about 10% in 2023, it said at its investor day. For fiscal 2024, eBay forecast revenue to grow in the range of 7% to 8%, and adjusted profit to rise about 15%.</p>
<p>Last month, eBay had forecast bleak first-quarter results as it tackles waning online demand, stiff competition and global supply chain disruptions.</p>
