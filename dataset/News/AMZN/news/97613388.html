<p>Ten years after the tragic killing of her 17-year-old son Trayvon Martin, Sybrina Fulton reflects on her grief, anger, and hope in the wake of a single unforgivable moment—and why she advocates for positive social change</p>
<p>(NASDAQ: AMZN)—Amazon Original Stories, an imprint of Amazon Publishing, announced today the release of the powerful essay Trayvon: Ten Years Later by Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin. Providing a deeply personal account of a family tragedy that unfolded on the world stage, Fulton imparts wisdom and shares the lessons she’s learned over these past ten years. Her essay is about life, love, and loss; about bad faith; about what changes have and have not occurred; and about the power of finding and using her voice.</p>

I hope that with my new essay and the work I have done over the last ten years, readers, watchers, and supporters will feel inspired to create something positive for the world we live in, and our children’s futures,” said Fulton. “From small good deeds to large scale cultural change, these transformations can honor Trayvon and others who senselessly lost their lives.”</p>
<p>“We are privileged to publish Sybrina Fulton’s powerful essay and thank her for her vulnerability, honesty, and inspiration,” said Selena James, editor at Amazon Original Stories. “Sybrina has become one of the most important activists of our time, and we are proud to work with her to share her essay with readers at this crucial moment in history.”</p>
