<p>(Alliance News) - The following is a round-up of updates by London-listed companies, issued on Thursday and not separately reported by Alliance News:</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Iofina PLC - Colorado, US-based manufacturing company that specialises in the production of iodine and the manufacture of speciality chemical derivatives - Reminds investors that the ramp-up of IO9, its iodine plant in Western Oklahoma, took longer than expected. Says that recent upgrades have improved the flow of brine water to the plant, adding that it has been able to steadily increase crystalline iodine production following the completion of this work. Confirms that the plant is now operating within its expected output range. Expects second-half production at the bottom, or very marginally below, the bottom end of the forecast range of 325 to 350 metric tonnes.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>SkinBioTherapeutics PLC - Newcastle, England-based life science company focused on skin health - Says that its AxisBiotix-Ps food supplement will launch on Amazon.co.uk from December 6. AxisBiotix-Ps is designed to help alleviate sensitive skin conditions like psoriasis. SkinBio Therapeutics says the sale of the product on Amazon is a key part of its commercialisation strategy, and that it aims to extend product availability through other Amazon country sites. Says management is already proactively seeking to expand online sales of AxisBiotix-Ps into France, Italy, and Spain, where the product has regulatory clearance.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Oncimmune Holdings PLC - Nottingham, England-based immunodiagnostics developer - Notes strategic progress towards end of first quarter, including contracts signed for four new projects, with additional contracts approved by customers and due to be signed in the second quarter. Says three of the contracts are with major pharmaceutical companies who were existing customers, while the fourth is with a new customer focused on "high throughput drug discovery". Chief Executive Officer Martin Gouldstone says: "I am encouraged to see the commercial traction already being made on delivering our strategy, including our ability to expand the application of our ImmunoINSIGHTS platform into drug discovery as well as clinical trials. I have recently spent time discussing our strategy with some of our key stakeholders and have been pleased to see how well it has been received, also allowing us to recruit top talent to further accelerate our ability to deliver on it."</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Baron Oil PLC - London-based oil &amp; gas exploration and appraisal company - Celebrates as its wholly-owned owned subsidiary, SundaGas Banda Unipessoal Lda, gets project classification from Autoridade Nacional do Petroleo for the Chuditch field. Sundagas is the operator of the TL-SO-19-16 production sharing contract, offshore Timor-Leste, while ANP is the Timor-Leste government regulator for oil and gas. The next step is the submission of a term of reference, including initial public consultations. Baron Oil adds that, regarding drilling, a Timorese drilling engineer has been recruited to join the SundaGas well operations team, and expressions of interest are being sought from in-country suppliers to provide services from the Timorese private sector. It also continues to evaluate all potential options for gas export from the Chuditch field in order to be able to fast track the concept selection processes.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>Arkle Resources PLC - Exploration company, with principal assets in Irish gold and zinc exploration licences - Says a drilling programme at Inishowen in County Donegal is due to begin this week. The drilling, which is a follow-up to work at the Meeneragh target, will test the main gold bearing outcrop. Four holes are planned in this phase from two drill pads drilling at minus 45 and minus 70 degrees. The focus of the programme will be on the main vein target discovered earlier. Chair John Teeling says: "It is good to get back on the ground again at Inishowen. This new round of drilling will test to see if we can trace the main vein along strike and at depth. We found high grade gold in the area and we now aim to expand this."</p>
