<p>July 8 (Reuters) - Nearly 900 Amazon workers at a warehouse in Britain will stage a strike for three days in the coming week over a pay dispute, labour union GMB said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The strike will take place from July 11-13 at Amazon's warehouse in Coventry, for two hours during the morning and two hours in the evening on the three days, GMB said in an emailed statement to Reuters. It coincides with a "Prime Day" sales event the company has announced for July 11-12.</p>
<p>"GMB members in Coventry have time and time again shown that this fight will only end with 15 pounds ($19.25) an hour and union rights," GMB Senior Organiser Rachel Fagan said.</p>
<p>Amazon did not respond to a Reuters request for comment outside business hours.</p>
<p>Last month, the union said that the Coventry warehouse workers had voted for six more months of strikes. The workers also went on strike last month from June 12-14.</p>
<p>Amazon is expected to record about $7 billion in revenue from its Prime Day sales, an increase of 12% from what was disclosed for Prime Day during the third quarter last year, according to JPMorgan.</p>
<p>Strikes have been called in several industries in Britain in recent months, including by nurses, teachers and transportation workers in response to inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>On Thursday, trade union RMT said the staff of the London Underground will strike from July 23-28 in a long-running dispute over pensions, job cuts and working conditions. ($1 = 0.7791 pounds) (Reporting by Anirudh Saligrama in Bengaluru)</p>
